However , despite their initial success , by the time the last examples were entering service they were already being replaced on some top-level duties by more powerful locomotives As they were slowly relegated from express passenger uses , the type found work on secondary passenger and freight services where they worked for many years . The final locomotives ended regular service in 1985 . The locomotives were commonly known as Whistlers because of the distinctive noise made by their turbochargers . Following the mixed success of the prototypes , another 190 locomotives were ordered by British Railways , and were numbered from D210 to D399 . All were built at Vulcan Foundry , except one batch of twenty ( Nos . D305\u2013D324 ) which were built at Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns factory in Darlington . All the locomotives were painted in the British Railways diesel green livery , and the final locomotive , D399 , was delivered in September 1962 .

D200\u2013D324 , were built with steam-age disc headcode markers , which were used to identify services . Later , it was decided that locomotives should display the four character train reporting number ( or headcode ) of the service they were hauling , and Nos . D325\u2013D344 were built with split headcode boxes , which displayed two characters either side of the locomotives central gangway doors Another policy decision led to the discontinuing of the gangway doors ( which enabled train crew to move between two or three locomotives in multiple ) .

These published works were written by cemetery superintendents , illustrating points of importance they would like share with their fellow cemetery superintendents . The Association was devoted to the betterment of cemeteries and their maintenance . The Association was successful in improving the state of cemeteries across the United States , and in encouraging cemetery superintendents to keep their graveyards well-maintained . One example of the Association\u2019s effect on society would be its improvement of cemeteries in rural America . One of the AACS\u2019s concerns was that of the upkeep of rural cemeteries , and how to improve and gather interest in them .

This essay diagrammed different land plotting techniques , and how to landscape different areas to improve the look of unused plots . In 1890 , the AACS created guidelines for headstone size , standardized the height of grave mounds to 4 inches , and limited the amount of monuments on family plots to 1 . The AACS also limited the number of vaults in a cemetery and gave recommendations to the best material to build monuments and vaults out of .

The PRR used them for freight service on the Northeast Corridor . They continued in service under Penn Central and Conrail until Conrail abandoned its electric operations in the early 1980s . They were then acquired by Amtrak and NJ Transit , where they lived short lives ; all were retired by the mid-1980s . One is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania . After the 1968 Penn Central merger , the E44s remained in freight service , over the same territory as before , and ( unlike much of the Penn Central diesel fleet ) , as reliably as before . The paint scheme for most units was Penn Central black with the worms in love logo . At least one unit wore the short-lived red-P logo , with the P in the logo red instead of white . Not all units received a full Penn Central paint scheme , mainly due to the cash-strapped nature of the railroad , which went bankrupt in June 1970 For example , some had white PC numbers and small worms on the ends , while a few never received any new lettering at all , instead having all their PRR markings simply patch-painted over except for their yellow numbers . In 1976 , they were passed to the newly formed Conrail . However , things changed when Conrail eliminated their electrification in 1981 . All 66 E44s were retired at that time , though some units were already stored due to economic downturn ; no unit had ever been retired or seriously wrecked . Most , though not all , of the E44s got to be repainted blue with Conrails white wheel on rail logo . \nQuestion: What was the operator of Pennsylvania Railroad class E44 between Dec 1978 and Aug 1979?",

Duncombe was a tireless champion of radical causes in the 27 years he served the North East London borough of Finsbury . But he was equally well known for his style ; he was , it was often said , the handsomest and best-dressed man in the house , and his love for theatre , gaming and women were well publicized Duncombe was elected and then returned to his seat seven times by the shopkeepers , artisans and laborers , the Nonconformists , Catholics , and Jews of Finsbury , making him the longest-sitting representative of a metropolitan borough in his day . His constituents called him Honest Tom Duncombe with great affection ; to his detractors he was known as the Dandy Demagogue or the Radical Dandy . His name was celebrated in working mens newspapers and frequently mentioned in the gossip sheets of high society . Duncombe was , as The Times put it delicately upon his death , a character . Even his critics , of which he had many , had to admit that as a debater Duncombe was one of the best in the House of Commons . His jocular manner disarmed his opponents and charmed his supporters . His polemical speaking style , and sartorial dressing style , was even parodied by Charles Dickens in a brief sketch in Nicholas Nickleby . Exhibiting a new style of politics , Duncombe performed not only for the politicians assembled in the House but for the people out of doors , as the public were then called In spite of his dandified affectations , or perhaps\u2014given the growing popularity of commercial spectacles like the sights of the Vauxhall and Cremorne pleasure gardens and the Crystal Palace\u2014partly because of his colorful performance , he was immensely popular with the public . His open embrace of pleasure , his sartorial style and the perceived and real excesses of his personal life , far from being the distraction from politics as his critics frequently commented , may actually have been an integral asset to his popularity . \nQuestion: Thomas Slingsby Duncombe took which position in May 1840?",

Under his leadership , the SPD grew from a tiny sect to become Germanys largest political party . He was the father of Karl Liebknecht and Theodor Liebknecht . From 1864 to 1865 , Liebknecht also worked for the magazine Der Social-Demokrat ( The Social Democrat ) published by Jean Baptista von Schweitzer . However , he soon found himself in disagreement with the papers friendly position toward Prussia and its new Minister-President Otto von Bismarck . So Liebknecht quit the editorial staff and was forced to leave the ADAV due to pressure from Schweitzer After being evicted from Berlin by government authorities , Liebknecht moved to Leipzig where he met August Bebel , with whom he founded the S\u00e4chsische Volkspartei ( Saxon Peoples Party ) in 1867 and the Social Democratic Workers Party of Germany ( Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands , SDAP ) in 1869 in Eisenach .

Liebknecht was also the editor of the party newspaper , Der Volksstaat ( The Peoples State ) .

As a result , he and Bebel were arrested and charged with treason . It is worth noting that Liebknecht opposed the war regardless of which side started it His call for revolutionary opposition to the war directly contradicts what his party ( the SPD ) would do in 1914 when World War I began as at that time , with Liebknecht long dead , his successors opted to back the German cause in the war . \nQuestion: Which party was Wilhelm Liebknecht a member of between Feb 1874 and Nov 1874?",

His first wife , Isabella I of Castile , died in 1504 . Germaines father was John of Foix , Viscount of Narbonne and son of Queen Eleanor of Navarre . Her mother , Marie of Orl\u00e9ans , was the sister of King Louis XII of France . In 1523 Charles V appointed the couple jointly viceroys of Valencia . There Germaine , recently returned to Spain , dealt with the fallout of the Revolt of the Brotherhoods by the Valencian guilds ( Germanies ) . Germaine favored harsh treatment of the agermanats ; she is thought to have signed the death warrants of 100 former rebels personally , and sources indicate that as many as 800 executions may have occurred in total . This undid the more lenient policy of Diego Hurtado de Mendoza , who had favored reconciliation with the rebels In December 1524 , Germaine signed a pardon that officially ended the persecution of all former participants in the rebellion . However , fines imposed on the guilds and guild-aligned cities as punishment would take many years to be repaid . It is maintained by Valencian historians that the fact that Germaine moved her court to Valencia was the first step in the degradation of social prestige of the Valencian language in the Kingdom of Valencia , as the higher classes started favouring Castilian/Spanish over their native language to please her . Next year after Johanns death in 1525 , Germaine married Ferdinand , Duke of Calabria , a son of King Frederick IV of Naples ( 1496\u20131501 ) by his second wife Isabella del Balzo . The two continued as viceroys of Valencia and were patrons of the arts and music . Germaine also encouraged the slow integration of Valencia with Castilian-dominated Spain as a whole . Germaine died on 15 October 1536 in Liria , probably due to obesity related edema , and was interred in the Monastery of San Miguel de los Reyes . The Duke of Calabria continued in office until his death in 1550 . \nQuestion: Who was the spouse of Germaine of Foix before Oct 1514?",

On a trip to Spain in 1865 , \u00c9douard Manet visited the Prado , where the art of Diego Vel\u00e1zquez was a revelation . Upon his return to Paris in 1866 , he began work on a new painting , depicting an anonymous regimental fifer of the Spanish army . In this picture , Manet presents the uniformed boy , in a manner that imitates and inverts the formula of V\u00e9lazquezs court portraits , against a barely inflected , flattened background of neutral tone , thus frustrating attempts to assess the figures true size and , by extension , importance . The painting , entitled Le fifre , was rejected by the jury of the Salon of 1866 . Outraged by the jurys decision , \u00c9mile Zola , an early champion of Manets art , published a series of articles in the newspaper L\u00c9venement , that praised Manets realist style and modern content . Following the example of Gustave Courbet , in May 1867 , Manet personally funded and mounted an exhibition of his own work in a pavilion at the edge of the \u00c9xposition universelle The exhibition included Le fifre , which was ridiculed in the popular press for its unusual brushwork and inscrutable spatial setting . The painting was acquired by Durand-Ruell in 1872 and again in 1893 . Between 1873 and 1893 , the painting was owned by Manets friend , composer and baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure . It was included in a large exhibition of Manets work in 1884 , a year after his premature death . Le fifre was accepted by the French government in lieu of taxes on the estate of its last private owner , the Count Isaac de Camondo , and entered the national collections in 1911 . It was displayed at the Louvre from 1914 until 1947 , when it was relocated to the Mus\u00e9e du Jeu de Paume . It was included in the sweeping Manet retrospective held at the Grand Palais in 1983 , the 100th anniversary of the artists death . In 1986 , it was moved to its current home in the Mus\u00e9e dOrsay , the national museum of 19th-century art . It has since traveled in exposition ; for example , in 2017 and 2018 it was on loan to the Louvre Abu Dhabi museum in Abu Dhabi , UAE . \nQuestion: The Fifer was owned by whom in early 1890s?",

That Klemzig is now in western Poland and is now known by the Polish name Kl\u0119psk . The initial establishment of Klemzig as an Old Lutheran settlement in the South Australian Colony is attributed to a decision by Pastor August Ludwig Christian Kavel . Pastor Kavel was determined to help his loyal parishioners emigrate from Brandenburg , Posen and Silesia to escape religious persecution by King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia . Pastor Kavel initially planned to move his parishioners to Russia near the Black Sea , where there were already numerous German settlements , but that had proved not to be feasible . Early in 1836 , Kavel travelled to Hamburg to investigate possible emigration to America , but lack of available financial assistance caused this plan to collapse . While in Hamburg , Kavel heard of the wealthy philanthropist , George Fife Angas , who was Chairman of the South Australian Company and likely to assist the Old Lutherans with their migration plans . Kavel and a representative of his congregation travelled to London in March 1836 and met a very sympathetic George Fife Angas . Angas was a Baptist and was convinced that the Old Lutherans , who placed such high value on their religious beliefs , would make excellent settlers in the South Australian Colony . Angas persuaded the Directors of the South Australian Company to support him in chartering and fitting out the barque Sarah which was to proceed to Hamburg . Here , 370 Old Lutherans were to set sail for South Australia on 8 June 1836 . However , Prussian authorities refused to grant the necessary passports until finally , after a distressing delay of nearly two years , the Prussian Government relented . Over the next six years , many ships brought Kavels Old Lutheran parishioners to the South Australian Colony . \nQuestion: What was the official name of Klemzig, South Australia after Oct 1937?",

It was published in Leipzig months before the Stock Market Crash of 1929 . While at Frankfurt in the mid-1920s , Grossman contended that a general tendency to cling to the results of Karl Marxs theory in ignorance of the subtleties of the method underlying Capital was causing a catastrophic vulgarisation of Marxian thought , a trend which was undermining the revolutionary possibilities of the moment . The Law of Accumulation was his attempt to demonstrate that Marxian political economy had been underestimated by its critics and by extension that revolutionary critiques of capitalism were still valid . Amongst other arguments , it sets forth the following demonstration ( for a complete definition of the terms employed , the whole book is recommended ) : Logical and mathematical basis of the law of breakdown .

He succeeded his rival Giovanni Vitelleschi , a fellow cardinal of military talent and inclination , as bishop of Tra\u00f9 and metropolitan bishop of Florence . Trevisan was also known as the Cardinal of Aquileia and the Cardinal Camerlengo . Trevisan was elected bishop of Tra\u00f9 on October 24 , 1435 , was consecrated soon after his election , and remained bishop until August 6 , 1437 , governing it through his vicar , Niccol\u00f2 , abbot of the monastery of S . Giovanni Battista in Tra\u00f9 . On August 6 , 1437 , Trevisan was promoted to metropolitan bishop of Florence , which he occupied until December 18 , 1439 There is record of Trevisan being in Ferrara with Eugene IV on January 23 , 1438 , and his subscription is found on the bull of union with the Greeks issued by Eugenius IV on July 4 , 1439 . Trevisan became Patriarch of Aquileia on December 18 , 1439 , and occupied that see until his death . On April 3 , 1440 , Trevisan was commissioned as papal legate in Romagna with the army , with the aim of recovering the lands of the Church . As a result , he undertook military operations starting on July 30 aimed at capturing Bologna but had to pause the campaign from November 23 to the following Spring , at which time he received a sizable sum from the Papal treasury . He succeeded Vitelleschi as the popes special deputy , possibly having engineered Vitelleschis downfall through his henchman , Antonio Rido , and began pacifying the forces still loyal to Vitelleschi and reducing the regions of Viterbo and Civitavecchia to papal obedience . As the popes special deputy he was the paymaster of the sizable papal army and controlled its large budget , and commanded it in the field . On June 4 , 1440 he received a special military standard and proceeded to Tuscany with a force of 3000 horsemen and 500 foot soldiers to support Francesco I Sforza and other papal and Florentine condottieri against Niccol\u00f2 Piccinino . Trevisan commanded the right flank of the combined papal-Florentine forces that defeated Piccinino in the Battle of Anghiari on June 29 . An account of his victory is also available in an important contemporary war poem , Trophaeum Anglaricum by Florentine humanist Leonardo Dati , which praises Trevisans caution as much as his impetuosity , comparing him to captains of antiquity such as Alexander the Great and Hannibal . \nQuestion: What position did Ludovico Trevisan take before Feb 1440?",

Raphael Sch\u00e4fer learned German in a few months . Sch\u00e4fer began his footballing career at SC Drispenstedt in a suburb of Hildesheim . At the age of 12 he was scouted by Hannover 96 and joined the ranks of their youth teams . He became part of the first-team squad with 17 but never made it into the starting line-up . Thus , he decided to join Regionalliga side VfB L\u00fcbeck before the 1998\u201399 season . At L\u00fcbeck he quickly became the first-choice goalkeeper but his team failed to qualify for the 2 .

Beginning in the 1940s , he advanced theories about global ocean circulation patterns and the behavior of the Gulf Stream that form the basis of physical oceanography today . Widely recognized as one of the most influential and productive oceanographers of his time , Stommel was both a groundbreaking theoretician and an astute , seagoing observer . He was research associate at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution from 1944 to 1959 where the Office of Naval Research generously supported his projects . He became professor of oceanography at Harvard University in 1959 and moved to Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1963 , where he remained until 1978 , returning to Woods Hole until his retirement . Stommel established the PANULIRUS station ( begun in 1954 ) in Bermuda . PANULIRUS was the name of a wooden , round bilged research vessel ( thus R/V Panulirus ) operated by the Bermuda Biological Station for Research for many years On a monthly schedule , the vessel obtained sea water samples at vertical intervals from the surface to great depths , which yielded temperature , salinity and some additional chemical data . Because the sea bottom falls away very sharply , particularly to the East-south-east of Bermuda , it is possible to obtain a representative sampling within a few miles of land . The resulting data set constitutes the longest such data series of similar character in the North Atlantic Ocean . Stommel was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1962 and received the National Medal of Science in 1989 . \nQuestion: Henry Stommel became a member of what organization or association in 1961?",

Originally they were designed by S . D . Holden , but were much rebuilt , resulting in several subclasses . Seventy-one S69 locomotives were built between 1911 and 1921 and numbered 1500\u20131570 . Fifty-one of these were built at the GERs Stratford Works and the remaining 20 by William Beardmore and Company . A further 10 locomotives were built by Beyer , Peacock and Company for the LNER in 1928 and numbered 8571\u20138580 . From 1948 the British Railways numbers were 61500\u201361580 ( with gaps ) . At the time of their introduction , the Claud Hamilton 4-4-0s were becoming outclassed on the heaviest express . Although an enlarged 4-4-0 design was mooted , it was realised that any such design would have too high an axle load for the tracks of the Great Eastern Railway , which had a relatively low restriction . Another design constraint was the short turntables used at the time . This meant that a 4-6-0 design was decided upon , although the design was relatively short compared to similar designs introduced at the same time . \nQuestion: What operated GER Class S69 between May 1934 and Feb 1945?",

The following year he went into partnership with the industrialist John Brunner to work on bringing the process to commercial viability . They established the business of Brunner Mond & Company , building a factory at Winnington , Northwich . Mond solved some of the problems in the process that had made mass production difficult , and by 1880 he had turned it into a commercially sound process Within 20 years the business had become the largest producer of soda ash in the world . Mond continued to research new chemical processes . He discovered nickel carbonyl , a previously unknown compound and the first-discovered in the class of metal carbonyls , which could be easily decomposed to produce pure nickel from its ores through the Mond process .

His departure from the team was officially announced on 29 March . CSC announced that they would not renew the contract in spring 2008 , meaning Riis Cycling A/S would need a new main sponsor from 2009 . Mid-June , Riis Cycling A/S announced that Saxo Bank had entered a three-year contract as name sponsor , with immediate effect , so the team entered the 2008 Tour de France as Team CSC Saxo Bank .

Robinson published the first consultative document on reorganisation and the need for administrative reform of the National Health System . One compromise he instituted was to reduce the number of hospital beds , under an argument of current under-utilization , and in agreement with the medical profession . In return , the government lifted the limits on fees that medical consultants could charge to patients These actions helped to form the basis for the 1966 General Practitioners Charter , which Robinson negotiated with Dr . James Cameron , the General Medical Services Committee chairman . Robinson also placed emphasis on nursing , appointing Sir Brian Salmon to a special committee of management experts and nurses , which looked into ways to advise and prepare senior staff at hospitals for their posts . \nQuestion: What was the position of Kenneth Robinson between Jul 1949 and Jan 1950?",

The devices , called OSHbots , were supplied by a Mountain View company called Fellow Robots . The OSHbots resembled white columns with two large LCD screens and were equipped with 3D cameras , so they could identify items brought in by customers , and had wheels on either side that helped them move Customers could research items on the screens and then the robot could lead them to the aisle where an item was located . The robots spoke English and Spanish and were connected to an inventory database so they could inform customers if an item was out of stock . The robots were the result of a process that Lowes uses for new developments . According to Lowes Innovation Labs director Kyle Nel , What we actually do is use a process called science fiction prototyping , where we give all our marketing research and trend data to professional published science fiction writers .

Reiniger is also noted for having devised the first form of a multiplane camera ; she made more than 40 films , all using her invention . Reiniger had a distinct art style in her animations that was very different from other artists in the time period of the 1920s and the 1930s , particularly in terms of characters . In the 1920s especially , characters tended to rely on facial expressions to express emotions or action , while Reinigers characters relied on gestures to display emotions or actions . She also utilized the technique of metamorphosis often in her animations . This focus on transformation greatly benefits her tendency to work with fairytale stories The Adventures of Prince Achmed specifically adapts fantastic elements to take advantage of animation to show things that could not be shown in reality . Reiniger considered animations separation from the laws of the material plane to be one of the greatest strengths of the medium . Because of this , Reinigers characters are not usually biologically correct , but they are able to express a fluidity which is very important to her style of expressionism . Although there are other animators in that time period that used these techniques , Reiniger stands out because she is able to accomplish this style using cutout animation .

On a trip to Spain in 1865 , \u00c9douard Manet visited the Prado , where the art of Diego Vel\u00e1zquez was a revelation . Upon his return to Paris in 1866 , he began work on a new painting , depicting an anonymous regimental fifer of the Spanish army . In this picture , Manet presents the uniformed boy , in a manner that imitates and inverts the formula of V\u00e9lazquezs court portraits , against a barely inflected , flattened background of neutral tone , thus frustrating attempts to assess the figures true size and , by extension , importance . The painting , entitled Le fifre , was rejected by the jury of the Salon of 1866 . Outraged by the jurys decision , \u00c9mile Zola , an early champion of Manets art , published a series of articles in the newspaper L\u00c9venement , that praised Manets realist style and modern content . Following the example of Gustave Courbet , in May 1867 , Manet personally funded and mounted an exhibition of his own work in a pavilion at the edge of the \u00c9xposition universelle The exhibition included Le fifre , which was ridiculed in the popular press for its unusual brushwork and inscrutable spatial setting . The painting was acquired by Durand-Ruell in 1872 and again in 1893 . Between 1873 and 1893 , the painting was owned by Manets friend , composer and baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure . It was included in a large exhibition of Manets work in 1884 , a year after his premature death . Le fifre was accepted by the French government in lieu of taxes on the estate of its last private owner , the Count Isaac de Camondo , and entered the national collections in 1911 . It was displayed at the Louvre from 1914 until 1947 , when it was relocated to the Mus\u00e9e du Jeu de Paume . It was included in the sweeping Manet retrospective held at the Grand Palais in 1983 , the 100th anniversary of the artists death . In 1986 , it was moved to its current home in the Mus\u00e9e dOrsay , the national museum of 19th-century art . It has since traveled in exposition ; for example , in 2017 and 2018 it was on loan to the Louvre Abu Dhabi museum in Abu Dhabi , UAE . \nQuestion: Who was the owner of The Fifer after Feb 1911?",

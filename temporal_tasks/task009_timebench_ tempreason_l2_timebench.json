He was an early Zionist and the first Dean of Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is known for his contributions to axiomatic set theory, especially his additions to Ernst Zermelo's axioms, which resulted in the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory.Abraham Adolf Halevi Fraenkel studied mathematics at the Universities of Munich, Berlin, Marburg and Breslau. After graduating, he lectured at the University of Marburg from 1916, and was promoted to professor in 1922.In 1919 he married Wilhelmina Malka A. Prins (1892\u20131983). Due to the severe housing shortage in post-war Germany, for a few years the couple lived as subtenants at professor Hensel's place.After leaving Marburg in 1928, Fraenkel taught at the University of Kiel for a year. He then made the fateful choice of accepting a position at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which had been founded four years earlier, where he spent the rest of his career. He became the first Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics, and for a while served as Rector of the University.Fraenkel was a fervent Zionist and as such was a member of Jewish National Council and the Jewish Assembly of Representatives under the British mandate. He also belonged to the Mizrachi religious wing of Zionism, which promoted Jewish religious education and schools, and which advocated giving the Chief Rabbinate authority over marriage and divorce.Fraenkel's early work was on Kurt Hensel's p-adic numbers and on the theory of rings. He is best known for his work on axiomatic set theory, publishing his first major work on the topic \"Einleitung in die Mengenlehre\" (Introduction to set theory) in 1919. In 1922 and 1925, he published two papers that sought to improve Zermelo's axiomatic system; the result is the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms. Fraenkel worked in set theory and foundational mathematics.Fraenkel also was interested in the history of mathematics, writing in 1920 and 1930 about Gauss's works in algebra, and he published a biography of Georg Cantor. After retiring from the Hebrew University and being succeeded by his former student Abraham Robinson, Fraenkel continued teaching at the Bar Ilan University in Ramat Gan (near Tel Aviv). \nQuestion: Which employer did Abraham Fraenkel work for in Sep, 1914?",

His father was a school master at Netherthorpe Grammar School in Staveley. He went to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1923 where he studied Mathematics, later gaining a PhD in 1929 under Ralph H. Fowler.From 1930 he lectured in Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. During his time in Edinburgh (in 1931) he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir Edmund Taylor Whittaker, Sir Charles Galton Darwin, Edward Copson and Charles Glover Barkla. He won the Society's Keith Medal (jointly with Edward Copson) for the period 1939\u201341.In 1932 he moved to Imperial College London as a Reader. In 1936 he became Professor of Mathematics and head of the mathematics department at the Queen's University of Belfast.In the Second World War he was co-opted onto the Admiralty Operational Research Group. After the war, he joined the mathematics department at Royal Holloway College in 1944 (the McCrea Building on Royal Holloway's campus is named after him). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1952.In 1965, McCrea created the astronomy centre of the physics department at the University of Sussex.McCrea died on 25 April 1999 at Lewes in Sussex.In 1933 he married Marian Core (d. 1995) and had three children.In 1928, he studied Albrecht Uns\u00f6ld's hypothesis, and discovered that three-quarters of the Sun is made of hydrogen, and about one quarter is helium, with 1% being other elements. Previous to this many people thought the Sun consisted mostly of iron. After this, people realised most stars consist of hydrogen.In 1964 he proposed mass transfer mechanism as an explanation of blue straggler stars.McCrea was president of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1961 to 1963 and president of Section A of the British Association for the Advancement of Science from 1965 to 1966.He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1985.

The last years of the reign of Isabella II were times of growing discontent with her government and with the monarchy. Salmer\u00f3n joined a small party who advocated for the establishment of a republic. He was director of the opposition paper \"La Discusi\u00f3n\", and co-operated with Emilio Castelar on \"La Democracia\". In 1865 he was named one of the members of the directing committee of the Republican Party. In 1867 he was imprisoned with other suspects.When the revolution of September 1868 broke out, he was at Almer\u00eda recovering from a serious illness. Salmer\u00f3n was elected to the \"Cortes\" in 1871, and though he did not belong to the Socialist Party, defended its right to toleration. When Amadeo of Savoy resigned the Spanish crown on 11 February 1873 Salmer\u00f3n was naturally marked out to be a leader of the party which endeavoured to establish a republic in Spain. After serving as minister of justice in the Figueras cabinet, he was chosen president of the \"Cortes\", and then, on 18 July 1873, president of the Executive Power of the Republic, in succession to Francisco Pi y Margall. He became president at a time when the Federalist Party had thrown all the south of Spain into anarchy.Salmer\u00f3n was compelled to use the troops to restore order. When, however, he found that the generals insisted on executing rebels taken in arms, he resigned (September 6) on the ground that he was opposed to capital punishment. He was again elected president of the Cortes on September 9. His successor, Castelar, was compelled to restore order by drastic means. Salmer\u00f3n took part in the attack made on him in the \"Cortes\" on 3 January 1874, which provoked the generals into closing the chamber and establishing a provisional military government. Salmer\u00f3n went into exile and remained abroad till 1881, when he was recalled by Sagasta.In 1886, he was elected to the \"Cortes\" as Progressive deputy for Madrid, and unsuccessfully endeavoured to combine the jarring republican factions into a party of practical moderate views. On 18 April 1907 he was shot at, but not wounded, in the streets of Barcelona by a member of the more extreme Republican Party. He died at Pau on 21 September 1908 at the age of 70.He was the last living president of the First Spanish Republic. \nQuestion: Which political party did Nicol\u00e1s Salmer\u00f3n y Alonso belong to in Jan, 1873?",

Atkinson's theorem and Atkinson\u2013Wilcox theorem are named after him. His Ph.D. advisor at Oxford was Edward Charles Titchmarsh.The following synopsis is condensed (with permission) from Mingarelli's tribute to Atkinson. He attended St Paul's School, London from 1929-1934. The High Master of St. Paul\u2019s once wrote of Atkinson: \"Extremely promising: He should make a brilliant mathematician\"!Atkinson attended The Queen's College, Oxford in 1934 with a scholarship. During his stay at Queen's, he was secretary of the Chinese Student Society, and a member of the Indian Student Society.Auto-didactic when it came to languages, he taught himself and became fluent in Latin, Ancient Greek, Urdu, German, Hungarian, and Russian with some proficiency in Spanish, Italian, and French. His dissertation at Oxford in 1939 established, among other such results, asymptotic formulae for the average value of the square of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line. His final Examining Board at Oxford University consisted of G.H. Hardy, J.E. Littlewood and E.C. Titchmarsh.His first academic appointment was at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1939-1940, followed by a commission (1940) in the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park. At this time he met Dusja Haas, later to become his wife. He then took a position as Lecturer in Christ Church, Oxford. From 1948-1955 he was Full Professor in Mathematics (Chair, and Dean of Arts) at University College, Ibadan, in Nigeria. He joined Canberra University College (now part of Australian National University) in 1955 as Head of its Department of Mathematics. He left for the University of Toronto, in Toronto, Canada, in 1960 where he was Professor until his retirement in 1982 and Professor Emeritus until his death in 2002.His honors include: Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (1967), U.

Lemaitre has also authored several books on the topic of narcissism in science.Lemaitre obtained a PhD in genetics from the Universit\u00e9 Pierre-et-Marie-Curie in 1992, defending a thesis on the regulation of P element transposition in Drosophila. He then pursued work as research associate in the laboratory of Jules Hoffmann, where he identified Toll-like receptors as essential mediators of innate immunity in Drosophila. This work was considered as a landmark paper by the Nobel prize committee and was featured in the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded to Hoffmann. In 1998, he was appointed group leader at the Molecular Genetics Center of the French National Center for Scientific Research in Gif-sur-Yvette. He moved to EPFL in 2007 as a full professor within the Global Health Institute.Lemaitre has since 2016 published several books and essays related to the topic of narcissism in science and society. He is co-author of various MOOCs and an exercise book in French on the topic of immunology.The Lemaitre laboratory studies various aspects of innate immunity using Drosophila as a genetic model. The laboratory uses genetic screens as tools to identify novel factors involved in the immune response following microbial infection. His team has contributed to the better understanding the role of the Toll and NF-\u03baB pathways in the activation of bacterial defense, as well as how the host's immune system discriminates between different bacterial pathogens. Lemaitre also studies host-microbiota interactions, and more specifically how the microbiota influences gut homeostasis and morphology.Another aspect of interest to Lemaitre is to decipher the roles and mechanisms of the interactions occurring between Drosophila and its endosymbionts of the spiroplasma genus.Lemaitre received two \"Advanced Grants\" from the European Research Council for projects on gut immunity and homeostasis (2008) and Drosophila-Spiroplasma interactions (2013).Lemaitre was elected as an EMBO member in 2007.He received several research prizes, such as the Noury, Thorlet, Lazare Prize from the French Academy of Sciences (2001), the First Prize of the Schlumberger Foundation (2002), the William B.

It is exhibited at the Rijksmuseum of Amsterdam, and signed, below the window in the lower left-hand corner, \"I V MEER\".The painting is made in oil on canvas, and it is a relatively small painting, being high by wide.The painting, showing a quiet street, depicts a typical aspect of the life in a Dutch Golden Age town. It is one of only three Vermeer paintings of views of Delft, the others being \"View of Delft\" and the now lost \"House Standing in Delft\". This painting is considered to be an important work of the Dutch master.Straight angles alternate with the triangle of the house and of the sky giving the composition a certain vitality. The walls, stones and brickwork are painted in a thicker paint layer, such that it makes them almost palpable.Vermeer achieved the realistic depiction of the surfaces with the masterful application of a relatively limited number of pigments. He employed red ochre and madder lake for the reddish-brown brick wall, the blue in the sky contains lead white and natural ultramarine. The green shutters and foliage are painted with azurite mixed with lead-tin-yellow.While generally agreed to depict a contemporary street scene in 17th-century Delft, where Vermeer lived and worked, the exact location of the scene Vermeer painted has long been a topic of research and discussion, with studies arguing for the Voldersgracht, where the Vermeer Centre is located, or the Nieuwe Langendijk at the present-day numbers 22 to 26.In 2015, archival research based on the city's quay dues register, which gives detailed measurements of all houses and passageways along the canals of Delft at the time, has resulted in the conclusion that the site is the Vlamingstraat, a street with a narrow canal, at the present-day numbers 40 and 42.The research also found that the property on the right in the painting belonged to Vermeer\u2019s aunt, Ariaentgen Claes van der Minne. She had a business selling tripe, and the passageway beside the house was known as the \"Penspoort\", or Tripe Gate. Vermeer\u2019s mother and sister also lived on the same canal, diagonally opposite.In 2017, this apparently sound conclusion was disputed by art historians Gert Eijkelboom and Gerrit Vermeer in the Dutch \"Journal of Historical Geography\" (\"Tijdschrift voor historische geografie\"). Their argumentation is essentially founded in the assertion that the painting does not depict an actual place, and thus cannot be accurately located. The authors said: \"We do not know whether the question will ever be answered, because it seems that Vermeer's world-famous work is an allegorical representation, which he compiled from various elements and places.\" \nQuestion: Who was the owner of The Little Street in May, 1885?",

Following the Grecians' relegation from the English Football League in 2003 he was made club captain, and despite injury problems that kept him out for much of the 2004/05 season.In July 2006, Cronin signed a contract with Football League Two club Chester City. He missed much of the 2006/07 season with a foot injury. After working his way to recovery, a further foot injury in July 2007 ultimately caused Chester to release him from his contract on 21 November 2007.Cronin signed for Bohemians on 27 February 2008 and slotted seamlessly into the side as Bohs marched to the 2008 Premier Division title. Cronin also added an FAI Cup winners medal as Bohs achieved the \"Double\" by beating Derry City on penalties after a 2\u20132 draw. The 2009 season was also a successful one for Cronin when, firstly, the Gypsies won the League of Ireland Cup by beating Waterford United 3\u20131 at the RSC. The success did not end there though as Bohemians won their first back-to-back titles in the club's 119-year history, beating rivals Shamrock Rovers by 4 points. Despite winning the Setanta Sports Cup, Bohemians had a disappointing 2010 season where the club lost their league title on goal difference and failed to make an impact in Europe where they made an embarrassing exit to Welsh side The New Saints. Cronin was one of the club's bright spots though as he had his best season at Bohs to date.Following financial cutbacks at Bohemians at the end of the 2011 season, Cronin departed Bohemians after four successful seasons to join newly promoted local rivals Shelbourne for the 2012 season.Cronin has represented the Republic of Ireland at youth and levels.\"Correct as of 26 October 2012.\" \nQuestion: Which team did Glenn Cronin play for in Jun, 2012?",

Economist Milton Friedman said Savage was \"one of the few people I have met whom I would unhesitatingly call a genius.\"He graduated from the University of Michigan and later worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan, Yale University, and the Statistical Research Group at Columbia University. Though his thesis advisor was Sumner Myers, he also credited Milton Friedman and W. Allen Wallis as statistical mentors.His most noted work was the 1954 book \"The Foundations of Statistics\", in which he put forward a theory of subjective and personal probability and statistics which forms one of the strands underlying Bayesian statistics and has applications to game theory.During World War II, Savage served as chief \"statistical\" assistant to John von Neumann, the mathematician credited with describing the principles upon which electronic computers should be based. Later he was one of the participants in the \"Macy conferences\" on cybernetics.One of Savage's indirect contributions was his discovery of the work of Louis Bachelier on stochastic models for asset prices and the mathematical theory of option pricing. Savage brought the work of Bachelier to the attention of Paul Samuelson. It was from Samuelson's subsequent writing that \"random walk\" (and subsequently Brownian motion) became fundamental to mathematical finance.In 1951 he introduced the minimax regret criterion used in decision theory.The Hewitt\u2013Savage zero\u2013one law is (in part) named after him, as is the Friedman\u2013Savage utility function. \nQuestion: Which employer did Leonard Jimmie Savage work for in Jan, 1945?",

Though thoroughly convinced of the soundness of his method of electing representatives and ready to defend it in the cabinet or the parliament, he made no effort to bring it to the attention of scientific men and statesmen in other countries, much less to defend his claim as an inventor.In 1842, Andr\u00e6 married Hansine Pouline Schack, an early feminist, who commented on his political views in her diaries, published from 1914 to 1920 as \"Geheimeraadinde Andr\u00e6s politiske Dagb\u00f8ger\".He died on 2 February 1893.

Currently playing in the first division, it holds home games at the Paralimni Municipal Stadium \"Tasos Marcou\", which holds 5,800 people.Enosis Neon Paralimniou was founded in April 1944, following the merger of two Paralimni clubs, Heracles and People's Love.The club's emblem is the Parthenon, with a trumpeter and the year 1936 inscription, birth year of the club Heracles. The only reason why founders decided to adopt the year 1936 as the new club's birth year instead of the year 1944 has purely to do with Heracles official papers. On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4\u20135 loss).The team\u2019s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore. Moore donated West Ham United kits for the team to play in 1971, 2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division . These colours became an established part of the club itself.Until the early 1960s, Enosis took part only in local competitions, since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions, stating that only clubs based in towns could take part. The CFA's denial was the reason why Enosis joined E.A.P.O., a village-based club association. In 1965, the CFA changed its rules and Enosis finally managed to join and participate in the second division. From the very beginning, the side tried to win promotion to the first division and, after four attempts, managed to finish first, in the football season of 1968\u201369. Since then, Enosis has taken part in all 45 editions of first division, being one of only five clubs never to have been demoted into the second division until 2013\u201314, when it was relegated for the first time to the second division after finishing 13th in the league. \nQuestion: Who was the head coach of the team Enosis Neon Paralimni FC in Aug, 2016?",

He studied for the bar and became advocate in 1811. Having been elected Member of Parliament for the Ayr Burghs in 1818, he devoted the greater part of his life to the promotion of liberal reforms.In 1820 he married the only daughter of Sir Samuel Romilly. He was greatly assisted by Lord Cockburn, then Mr. Henry Cockburn, and a volume of correspondence published by Kennedy in 1874 forms a curious and interesting record of the consultations of the two friends on measures which they regarded as requisite for the political regeneration of their native country. One of the first measures to which he directed his attention was the withdrawal of the power of nominating juries from the judges, and the imparting of a right of peremptory challenge to prisoners. Among other subjects were the improvement of the parish schools, of pauper administration, and of several of the corrupt forms of legal procedure which then prevailed.Kennedy took a prominent part in the construction of the Scottish Reform Act 1832; indeed he and Lord Cockburn may almost be regarded as its authors. After the accession of the Whigs to office in 1832 he held office in the ministry as Clerk of the Ordnance in 1832 and as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from 1832 to 1834, and most of the measures of reform for Scotland, such as burgh reform, the improvements in the law of entail, and the reform of the sheriff courts, owed much to his sagacity and energy. In 1837 he went to Ireland as pay master of civil services, and set himself to the promotion of various measures of reform. Kennedy retired from office in 1854, but continued to take keen interest in political affairs and up to his death in 1879 took a great part in both county and parish business. He had a stern love of justice, and a determined hatred of everything savouring of corruption or dishonesty. \nQuestion: Which position did Thomas Francis Kennedy hold in Feb, 1831?",

After teaching for one year at Princeton and two years at Harvard University (as the Benjamin Peirce Instructor), Franklin joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Department of Mathematics, where he stayed until his 1964 retirement.In 1922, Franklin gave the first proof that all planar graphs with at most 25 vertices can be four-colored.In 1928, Franklin gave the first description of an orthonormal basis for \"L\"\u00b2([0,1]) consisting of continuous functions (now known as \"Franklin's system\").In 1934, Franklin disproved the Heawood conjecture for the Klein bottle by showing that any map drawn on the Klein bottle can be coloured with at most six colours. An example which shows that six colours may be needed is the 12-vertex cubic graph now known as the Franklin graph.Franklin also worked with Jay W.

Soon afterwards, the Christopherson family moved to Porlock in Devon, where his father was vicar of Clovelly. As a boy, Christopherson suffered from asthma. He was educated privately until, at age 14, he was sent to Sherborne School in Dorset.He gained a scholarship at University College, Oxford, initially to read Mathematics. Later, in 1937, he achieved a first class degree in Engineering Science. The following year he went to Harvard University in the United States as a Henry Fellow, gaining an SM master's degree in 1938.He returned to Oxford University as a research assistant to Sir Richard Southwell FRS, working on numerical methods for applied mechanics. He contributed to Southwell's relaxation method. Christopherson was the first to apply the method in the solution of field differential equations, which later became the most important application. He gained his DPhil in 1941.In 1941, during World War II, Christopherson was appointed as a Scientific Officer in the Ministry of Home Security, working in theresearch and experimental department with Sir Reginald Stradling. His work involved investigating the effects of explosives on buildings, shelters, and firefighting (he worked with Solly Zuckerman and Hugh Cairns on researching helmet designs.Most of Christopherson's research was conducted at the University of Oxford (1937\u201341), the University of Cambridge (1945\u201349), and the University of Leeds (1949\u201355).

His career at Southampton got off to a slow start, scoring only once in his first three games before injury forced him to miss three games in October/November 1901. On his return from injury, he started to score more freely and by Christmas he had scored seven goals. In his next game he doubled his tally for the season as he scored a club record seven goals in a match against Northampton Town at The Dell on 28 December 1901. His first goal came almost straight from the kick-off and within five minutes he had completed his hat trick. By half time Saints were 7\u20130 up, with Brown contributing four.

At Bonn his fellow students included Georg Kaibel, Friedrich von Duhn, Georg Dehio and Hans Delbr\u00fcck. After graduation in 1873 he toured countries of the Mediterranean extensively.In 1881 he became an associate professor at the University of Kiel, followed by professorships at the Universities of Rostock (1883), Strasbourg (1888) and G\u00f6ttingen (1889). At the latter institution he was university rector (1903\u20134), and was a colleague of Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff. In 1889 he became a member of the G\u00f6ttingen Academy of Sciences.Much of Leo's earlier work concerned research of Seneca's tragedies and the writings of Venantius Fortunatus. Later his focus dealt largely with works of Roman playwright Plautus and early Roman literature in general. A few of his better known publications are the following:In 1883 Leo married C\u00e9cile Hensel (1858\u20131928), daughter of the landowner and entrepreneur Sebastian Hensel, granddaughter of the composer Fanny Mendelssohn and the painter Wilhelm Hensel and descendant of the entrepreneur and philosopher Moses Mendelssohn and sister of the philosopher Paul Hensel and the mathematician Kurt Hensel.

Currently playing in the first division, it holds home games at the Paralimni Municipal Stadium \"Tasos Marcou\", which holds 5,800 people.Enosis Neon Paralimniou was founded in April 1944, following the merger of two Paralimni clubs, Heracles and People's Love.The club's emblem is the Parthenon, with a trumpeter and the year 1936 inscription, birth year of the club Heracles. The only reason why founders decided to adopt the year 1936 as the new club's birth year instead of the year 1944 has purely to do with Heracles official papers. On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4\u20135 loss).The team\u2019s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore. Moore donated West Ham United kits for the team to play in 1971, 2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division . These colours became an established part of the club itself.Until the early 1960s, Enosis took part only in local competitions, since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions, stating that only clubs based in towns could take part. The CFA's denial was the reason why Enosis joined E.A.P.O., a village-based club association. In 1965, the CFA changed its rules and Enosis finally managed to join and participate in the second division. From the very beginning, the side tried to win promotion to the first division and, after four attempts, managed to finish first, in the football season of 1968\u201369. Since then, Enosis has taken part in all 45 editions of first division, being one of only five clubs never to have been demoted into the second division until 2013\u201314, when it was relegated for the first time to the second division after finishing 13th in the league. \nQuestion: Who was the head coach of the team Enosis Neon Paralimni FC in May, 2021?",

The building is three stories high and based on an Elizabethan-style \"E\"-shaped plan. The design is similar to that of the station but more subdued; the building was extended in 1878. The building is mainly brick-built, with blue stone diapering and a plain tiled roof and Dutch-style gables above the outer and central bay windows. The central ground floor bay forms a porch. The hotel was built to resemble an Elizabethan manor house. The hotel quickly built an up a good reputation and, within a few years, was regarded as one most important hotels in Staffordshire.When the County Borough of Stoke on Trent was formed in 1910, incorporating six towns, the hotel was chosen the venue for the inaugural meeting of the local council to avoid showing a bias by using one of the six town halls\u2014a matter of local sensitivity at the time. Subsequent meetings rotated between the town halls before the council decided to permanently locate itself in Stoke.The NSR preferred to lease the building, with limited success. When the NSR was amalgamated into the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923, the LMS took over the hotel and found the business in poor condition. When a lease expired in 1931, the LMS took the management of the hotel into its own hands and undertook an extensive refurbishment of the building. The hotel has been expanded several times during its history, including additional buildings to the rear, in order to provide more bedrooms and kitchen space. Not all the extensions were conducted sympathetically to the original architectural style, resulting in a variety of architectural styles to the rear of the building.The hotel became a listed building in 1972 and is listed in grade II*. It is located on Winton Square, immediately opposite Stoke-on-Trent railway station, and is one of four listed buildings on the square. The station itself is grade II* listed, and a statue of local potter Josiah Wedgwood is grade II listed; a row of railway cottages forms another grade II listed building. Winton Square is described as the UK's only piece of town planning undertaken by railway company specifically to set off a station.The hotel, by then owned by the nationalised British Rail, was sold in 1953 and today is owned by the Britannia Hotels chain, who acquired it in November 2002; it has 88 bedrooms. \nQuestion: Who was the owner of North Stafford Hotel in Jan, 1951?",

Flagg, of Grand Manan, New Brunswick.Gould left school at the age of 14 and started work for 4 shillings a week.In 1901 he obtained a position as an ordinary sailor on the ship \"Clan Graham\", and sailed for South Africa where he worked as a piecemeal laborer. He later moved from South Africa to New York where he worked for an insurance company.In 1912 he opened his own insurance company in London with offices in Belgium and Germany. The business closed within a year and Gould won a \u00a320,000 award against a partner in New York for misrepresentation.In 1915, with a capital of \u00a3200, Gould committed to buy the SS \"Dartsmouth\" for \u00a336,000. Due to the need for ships during the First World War to carry troops and goods, the venture was extremely successful, bringing capital to Gould and his company, Goulds Steamships & Industrials Ltd of \u00a360,000 within 6 months. The profits were re-invested with the purchase of a \u00a31,000,000 navy and shipbuilding business. By the end of the War it was estimated that Gould's personal fortune was around \u00a32\u00a0million. After the war there was a major recession in the maritime sector, with the number of shipping companies in Cardiff falling from 150 to 77; the Gould company went bankrupt with debts of over \u00a3750,000 in May 1925. In March 1926 he was discharged from bankruptcy on condition of paying \u00a350,000 towards his debts. He failed to pay the \u00a350,000 and was made bankrupt again in 1933. He was acquitted of the second bankruptcy, postponed for two years, in June 1934.Gould was a member of the City of Cardiff Council between 1917 and 1918. He stood for the Unionist Party (effectively the Conservative Party) in the elections of 1918, 1922 and 1923, winning the Cardiff Central constituency.

LevineDavid Knudsen Levine (born c. 1955) is department of Economics and Robert Schuman Center for Advanced Study Joint Chair at the European University Institute; he is John H. Biggs Distinguished Professor of Economics Emeritus at Washington University in St. Louis. His research includes the study of intellectual property and endogenous growth in dynamic general equilibrium models, the endogenous formation of preferences, social norms and institutions, learning in games, and game theory applications to experimental economics.At UCLA, Levine obtained a B.A. in mathematics in 1977, and an M.A. in economics in the same year. He was awarded a Ph.D. in economics at MIT in June 1981. He became an assistant professor of economics at UCLA in July 1981, an associate professor of economics at the University of Minnesota in 1987, and a professor of economics at UCLA in the same year. In 1997 he became the Armen Alchian Professor of Economics at UCLA. In 2006 he moved to Washington University in St. Louis, where he became the John H. Biggs Distinguished Professor of Economics.Levine was the coeditor of the \"Review of Economic Dynamics\" from November 1996 to June 2001, and of \"Econometrica\" from July 2003 to June 2008. He presided the Society for Economic Dynamics from July 2006 to June 2009.Levine is a Fellow of the Econometric Society since 1989 and a research associate at NBER since 2006.David K. Levine conducts ongoing research in general equilibrium theory, focusing specifically on growth theory, innovation, and intellectual property. Collaborating with Michele Boldrin, Levine examines the role of increasing returns in growth and innovation. They posit that little evidence exists for increasing returns at the aggregate level, and thus argue that there is no reason to believe that increasing returns play an important role in growth. This theory concludes that existing claims for the necessity of intellectual property in the process of growth and innovation are greatly exaggerated.Levine also conducts research in the field of dynamic games. He established with Drew Fudenberg that a long-lived player playing in opposition to short-lived players can substitute reputation for commitment. He developed with Eric Maskin the first \"folk theorem\" for games in which players do not directly observe each other's decisions, with applications for learning in games. They argued that while learning theories cannot provide detailed descriptions of non-equilibrium behavior, they act as a useful tool in understanding which equilibria are likely to emerge. One example of this, they put forward, explains how superstitions survive in the face of rational learning.Levine currently studies the endogenous formation of preferences and social norms. His analysis of experimental anomalies explores some of the limitations of the standard economic model of self-interested individuals. \nQuestion: Which employer did David K.

He fled first to Russia, where he stayed until 1939, and then to Paris. In 1939, he emigrated to the United States, where he would remain for the rest of life. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1951. He was a professor at Stanford University from 1952 until his retirement in 1972. He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts and in 1962 in Stockholm (\"On meromorphic functions of several complex variables\").

He was an early Zionist and the first Dean of Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is known for his contributions to axiomatic set theory, especially his additions to Ernst Zermelo's axioms, which resulted in the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory.Abraham Adolf Halevi Fraenkel studied mathematics at the Universities of Munich, Berlin, Marburg and Breslau. After graduating, he lectured at the University of Marburg from 1916, and was promoted to professor in 1922.In 1919 he married Wilhelmina Malka A. Prins (1892\u20131983). Due to the severe housing shortage in post-war Germany, for a few years the couple lived as subtenants at professor Hensel's place.After leaving Marburg in 1928, Fraenkel taught at the University of Kiel for a year. He then made the fateful choice of accepting a position at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which had been founded four years earlier, where he spent the rest of his career. He became the first Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics, and for a while served as Rector of the University.Fraenkel was a fervent Zionist and as such was a member of Jewish National Council and the Jewish Assembly of Representatives under the British mandate. He also belonged to the Mizrachi religious wing of Zionism, which promoted Jewish religious education and schools, and which advocated giving the Chief Rabbinate authority over marriage and divorce.Fraenkel's early work was on Kurt Hensel's p-adic numbers and on the theory of rings. He is best known for his work on axiomatic set theory, publishing his first major work on the topic \"Einleitung in die Mengenlehre\" (Introduction to set theory) in 1919. In 1922 and 1925, he published two papers that sought to improve Zermelo's axiomatic system; the result is the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms. Fraenkel worked in set theory and foundational mathematics.Fraenkel also was interested in the history of mathematics, writing in 1920 and 1930 about Gauss's works in algebra, and he published a biography of Georg Cantor. After retiring from the Hebrew University and being succeeded by his former student Abraham Robinson, Fraenkel continued teaching at the Bar Ilan University in Ramat Gan (near Tel Aviv). \nQuestion: Which employer did Abraham Fraenkel work for in Sep, 1931?",

With the death of the last surviving Knights of Vittorio Veneto in 2008, the order fell into abeyance and, in 2008, it was formally wound-up by repeal of the original legislation.It was revived anyway on 15 March 2010 in spite of being still abeyant. \nQuestion: Who was the chair of Order of Vittorio Veneto in Aug, 1999?",

LevineDavid Knudsen Levine (born c. 1955) is department of Economics and Robert Schuman Center for Advanced Study Joint Chair at the European University Institute; he is John H. Biggs Distinguished Professor of Economics Emeritus at Washington University in St. Louis. His research includes the study of intellectual property and endogenous growth in dynamic general equilibrium models, the endogenous formation of preferences, social norms and institutions, learning in games, and game theory applications to experimental economics.At UCLA, Levine obtained a B.A. in mathematics in 1977, and an M.A. in economics in the same year. He was awarded a Ph.D. in economics at MIT in June 1981. He became an assistant professor of economics at UCLA in July 1981, an associate professor of economics at the University of Minnesota in 1987, and a professor of economics at UCLA in the same year. In 1997 he became the Armen Alchian Professor of Economics at UCLA. In 2006 he moved to Washington University in St. Louis, where he became the John H. Biggs Distinguished Professor of Economics.Levine was the coeditor of the \"Review of Economic Dynamics\" from November 1996 to June 2001, and of \"Econometrica\" from July 2003 to June 2008. He presided the Society for Economic Dynamics from July 2006 to June 2009.Levine is a Fellow of the Econometric Society since 1989 and a research associate at NBER since 2006.David K. Levine conducts ongoing research in general equilibrium theory, focusing specifically on growth theory, innovation, and intellectual property. Collaborating with Michele Boldrin, Levine examines the role of increasing returns in growth and innovation. They posit that little evidence exists for increasing returns at the aggregate level, and thus argue that there is no reason to believe that increasing returns play an important role in growth. This theory concludes that existing claims for the necessity of intellectual property in the process of growth and innovation are greatly exaggerated.Levine also conducts research in the field of dynamic games. He established with Drew Fudenberg that a long-lived player playing in opposition to short-lived players can substitute reputation for commitment. He developed with Eric Maskin the first \"folk theorem\" for games in which players do not directly observe each other's decisions, with applications for learning in games. They argued that while learning theories cannot provide detailed descriptions of non-equilibrium behavior, they act as a useful tool in understanding which equilibria are likely to emerge. One example of this, they put forward, explains how superstitions survive in the face of rational learning.Levine currently studies the endogenous formation of preferences and social norms. His analysis of experimental anomalies explores some of the limitations of the standard economic model of self-interested individuals. \nQuestion: Which employer did David K.

R\u00e2\u0219nov was mentioned for the first time in 1331 as \"Rosnou\" and again in 1388 as \"villa Rosarum\". While the village was razed many times in its history by Tatars, Turks and Wallachians, the castle was conquered only once, in 1612 by Gabriel B\u00e1thory.In 2002, the R\u00e2\u0219nov Fortress and surroundings were used during the shooting of several scenes from the American film \"Cold Mountain\".There is a myth attached to R\u00e2\u0219nov Citadel. During a particularly long siege of the fortress, the citizens of R\u00e2\u0219nov were concerned about the lack of available fresh drinking water. Two Turkish soldiers, having been captured earlier, were put to the task of digging a well in the centre of the fortress. These two men were assured that they would be given their freedom once the well was completed. According to local legend, it took them 17 years to finish the well, but they were still killed afterwards. This famous well still sits in the centre of R\u00e2\u0219nov Fortress, and is 143 metres deep.R\u00e2\u0219nov has a warm-summer humid continental climate (\"Dfb\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification).As of August 2013, R\u00e2\u0219nov became the host of the first extreme metal festival in Romania, known as Rockstadt Extreme Fest which was held at the hill's base with the R\u00e2\u0219nov Citadel. The festival featured bands such as Decapitated, Napalm Death, Gojira, Carach Angren, Septicflesh, Primordial among many others and it continues to this day.R\u00e2\u0219nov Sports Complex was built just outside the town in C\u0103rbunarii Valley, for 2013 European Youth Winter Olympic Festival which was hosted in the nearby city of Bra\u0219ov.Two ski jumping events took place in R\u00e2\u0219nov, as part of the Women's Ski Jumping World Cup 2013/2014 competition.

He served until May 1945, when he was captured by the British. He returned to his former career, and joined the Iron and Metal Industry Association, which soon became part of IG Metall. He joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD), and gradually rose to more prominent positions in the union. From 1959, he was its district secretary for youth work and shop stewards.IG Metall was affiliated to the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB), and in 1963, Loderer was elected as the federation's Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg district secretary. In 1966, he took a leading role in an anti-fascist rally outside the conference of the National Democratic Party of Germany, and this propelled him to national attention.In 1968, Loderer was elected as deputy president of IG Metall, with the backing of president Otto Brenner. He was the union's lead on public relations, human resources, organisation, and administration. Brenner died in 1972, and Loderer was elected as his successor. While Loderer initially campaigned on issues such as banning lockouts, and expanding the role of workers in company management, the economic crisis led him to a more defensive position, and a focus on collective bargaining. He also presided over five major strikes. He was staunchly opposed to communists in the union, or to any co-operation with unions affiliated to the communist World Federation of Trade Unions, and criticised the peace movement for not spending enough time attacking the Soviet Union.In 1974, Loderer was elected as president of the International Metalworkers' Federation. He was elected in the European Parliament election, 1979, for the SPD in Hesse, but he stood down in January 1980, as he found the workload was incompatible with remaining leader of the union.

In 1670, he was promoted to the rank of \"jinshi\" and moved to Beijing, leaving his brother Li Guangpo behind to look after his family. Li's career prospects improved when the Emperor pacified Fujian and acted on Li's suggestion to defeat Wu Sangui. He also helped defeat Geng Jingzhong, persuading his friend Chen Minglei to work as a spy in Geng's camp. Later in life, he was responsible for planning Shi Lang's conquest of Taiwan. During the course of his life, Li held various court positions, including Chancellor of the Hanlin Academy, Governor of Zhili and Grand Secretary, and positions on the Board of War, Board of Civil Service and the Board of Public Works.Li's philosophy was rooted in the Cheng-Zhu school. However, despite being a follower of Zhu Xi he did not entirely disregard the teachings of Zhu's rivals Lu Jiuyuan and Wang Yangming. He also highlighted similarities between the teachings of Confucius and those of Buddha and Lao Tzu. Li felt that human nature (which he believed to be inherently good) was the ultimate subject of his study, and that nature was the guiding principle on which to base human morality. He had an interest in the sciences.Li wrote or edited a number of philosophical texts, including the \"Complete Works of Master Zhu\" (\"Zhuzi daquan\"), the \"Essential Ideas of Nature and Principle\" (\"Xingli jingli\") and the \"Interpretation of the Meaning of the Four Books\" (\"Si shu Jieyi\"). An expert on the \"I Ching\", he also wrote two books on the subject, the \"Penetrating Discourse\" (\"Zhouyi tonglun\") and the \"Balanced Annotations\" (\"Zhouyi zhezhong\"); the latter took the (at the time) unusual editorial step of segregating the original text of the \"I Ching\" from its subsequent commentaries. A complete collection of Li's works (around thirty books) was published around a hundred years after his death, entitled the \"Complete Works of Rongcun\" (\"Rongcun quanji\"). \nQuestion: Which position did Li Guangdi hold in Nov, 1704?",

On stepping down from the Post Office in 1854 he was appointed a Commissioner of Audit, remaining in post until 1867.In 1865, the Canadian Post Office Department Secretary William Dawson LeSueur named the settlement of Maberly, Ontario in Maberly's honour.He married Irish novelist Catherine C.

It was then relegated to the Beta Ethniki again in 2006\u201307 and returned to the top tier in 2007\u201308.

Straight after, Levadiakos played in the second division being close to relegation in almost every season. In the 1980s, the team was upgraded and in May 1987, players and supporters of the club celebrated the team's first ever promotion to Alpha Ethniki.

He has New Zealand citizenship by birth and has since acquired UK and Canadian citizenship.Jonathan Bennett was born in Greymouth, New Zealand to Francis Oswald Bennett and Pearl Allan Brash Bennett. His father was doctor and his mother a homemaker. He read philosophy at the University of Canterbury (formerly Canterbury University College) and was awarded his MA there in 1953. He then went to the University of Oxford where he was a member of Magdalen College, Oxford. He obtained his BPhil in 1955.Bennett's first academic post was as a Junior Lecturer at the University of Auckland, New Zealand (then Auckland University College) (1952). He was an instructor in Philosophy at Haverford College (Pennsylvania) (1955-56), then a lecturer in Moral Science (Philosophy) at the University of Cambridge (1956\u201368), then at Simon Fraser University (1968\u201370), the University of British Columbia (1970\u201379), and in 1979 he went to Syracuse University as Professor of Philosophy. He remained in this position until his retirement in 1997.In 1980, he was the Tanner Lecturer at Brasenose College of Oxford University. His lectures were refined and published in his 1995 book \"The Act Itself\". In this work he argues that letting someone die is as immoral as killing someone. This also applies to other harms that one commits or fails to prevent. This view has been widely discussed for example by Judith Jarvis ThomsonIn 1992, he was the John Locke Lecturer at the University of Oxford giving lectures on 'Judging Behaviour: Analysis in Moral Theory'. In 1985, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The British Academy extended him the same honour in 1991.

He began his career as a radio journalist for ORTF when he was just sixteen years old. He then became a television sports journalist at the age of twenty. He commentated on more than 1,000 football matches, including thirteen World Cups (beginning with the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile) and nine UEFA European Championships.Some of Thierry Roland's expressions in his comments of matches, such as: \"These two will not spend their holidays together\", \"Broke like a rabbit in full flight\", \"He swallowed the trumpet\", \"The balloon is went in the zig and he went in the zag \",\" He did not make the trip for nothing \"or\" This is not the right line of Longchamp \", contributed to his popularity.But, he was also very criticized for his frankness, for his insults towards the referee (\"Mr. Foote, you are a bastard !\") or about a Romanian referee \"I've never seen such a manure! Michel Hidalgo told me yesterday that Romanians were the easiest to buy \", its sexism and some expressions with racist connotation or simply abusive. Thus, commenting on the final of the 1966 Coupe de France for the ORTF, he explained after the victory of RC Strasbourg that \"the Cup left France\".His particular style earned him a recurring caricature of the humorous show \"Les Guignols de l'info\".Following the death of Thierry Roland, a minute of silence was observed in his honor during the France-Sweden UEFA Euro 2012 match in Kiev.

At Wellesley, her classmates included mathematicians Grace Andrews and Clara Latimer Bacon.She worked for two years as a teacher at Amesbury High School in Massachusetts, and was appointed as an instructor of mathematics at the Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (later to become the University of Rhode Island) in early 1892, the first year the school became a college. One month later she became its professor of mathematics and physics.While continuing to work at the college, Bosworth earned a master's degree at the University of Chicago from 1894 through 1896 through summer study with E. H. Moore and Oskar Bolza.In 1898, taking a leave from her work for the college, Bosworth traveled to the University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany, where she worked under the supervision of David Hilbert. She defended her dissertation there in 1899, and was awarded the Ph.D. in 1900. Her dissertation was \"Begr\u00fcndung einer vom Parallelenaxiome unabh\u00e4ngigen Streckenrechnung\", and concerned non-Euclidean geometry. She was David Hilbert's first female doctoral student, part of a group that later included Nadeschda Gernet (1902), Vera Myller (1906), Margarete Kahn (1909), Klara L\u00f6benstein (1910), and Eva Koehler (1912).In 1901 Bosworth married Theodore Moses Focke, an American civil engineer, materials scientist, and applied mathematician whom she had met in G\u00f6ttingen.

In November 1976, Hinshelwood switched to playing at right-back. Along with future England left-back Kenny Sansom, he shored up the Palace defence, and the club were promoted twice in three seasons, to reach the First Division in 1979. In that season, Hinshelwood only missed one game, as Palace went up as champions.Palace spent two years in the top flight, and Hinshelwood was voted as the fans' \"Player of the Year\" for both. As well as this, he gained two caps for the England under-21 side.Hinshelwood left Palace in 1983, transferring to Oxford United. There, he won the Third Division title for the first time (Palace had only gone up in third place). He then transferred back to south-London, to Millwall, where he won promotion to Division 2.

Currently playing in the first division, it holds home games at the Paralimni Municipal Stadium \"Tasos Marcou\", which holds 5,800 people.Enosis Neon Paralimniou was founded in April 1944, following the merger of two Paralimni clubs, Heracles and People's Love.The club's emblem is the Parthenon, with a trumpeter and the year 1936 inscription, birth year of the club Heracles. The only reason why founders decided to adopt the year 1936 as the new club's birth year instead of the year 1944 has purely to do with Heracles official papers. On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4\u20135 loss).The team\u2019s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore. Moore donated West Ham United kits for the team to play in 1971, 2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division . These colours became an established part of the club itself.Until the early 1960s, Enosis took part only in local competitions, since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions, stating that only clubs based in towns could take part. The CFA's denial was the reason why Enosis joined E.A.P.O., a village-based club association. In 1965, the CFA changed its rules and Enosis finally managed to join and participate in the second division. From the very beginning, the side tried to win promotion to the first division and, after four attempts, managed to finish first, in the football season of 1968\u201369. Since then, Enosis has taken part in all 45 editions of first division, being one of only five clubs never to have been demoted into the second division until 2013\u201314, when it was relegated for the first time to the second division after finishing 13th in the league. \nQuestion: Who was the head coach of the team Enosis Neon Paralimni FC in Mar, 2021?",

She is an emeritus professor in the biological sciences at the University of Quebec at Montreal. She is known for her work on gender, environmental health and ergonomics. She was given the Jacques Rousseau Award in 1993, the Governor General's Award in 2009, and was named an Officer of the Order of Canada on Dec.27, 2019 .Messing was born in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1943. She studied social sciences at Harvard before deciding to focus on science. She went to McGill University in Montreal where she studied biology, genetics and chemistry. She faced prejudice from colleagues because she was a single mother.She began teaching at University of Quebec at Montreal in 1976 and two years later she was conducting research amongst phosphate workers. She knew of the potential and radioactivity and discovered that amongst six workers, four of them had children with birth defects like a club foot. She did manage to get dust extraction equipment installed but only on the proviso that the researchers left the factory. Messing reflects that this event focused her later work on occupational health.In 1990 she spent a year studying a toilet cleaner named Nina who walked 23\u00a0km every day as she cleaned toilets in 1\u20132 minutes. This work led to recommendations that were adopted and to her specializing in ergonomics and winning an award. She was given the Jacques Rousseau Award in 1993. This award recognises leading Canadians who are working across disciplines.Messing co-founded the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Biology, Health, Society and the Environment (CINBIOSE) at her university.She has worked for thirty years to also increase opportunities for women. She chaired the committee that advises on gender and ergonomics at the International Association of Ergonomics. In recognition of this she was given the Governor General's Award in 2009 that commemorates the 80th anniversary of the persons case. This was a case where Canadian acknowledged that women were included in the legal phrase of \"person\" and were therefore entitled to all those legal rights.She was given the Yant Award in 2014. \nQuestion: Where was Karen Messing educated in Jan, 1990?",

There are many Slutsky analogs in producer theory.He is less well known by Western economists than some of his contemporaries, due to his own changing intellectual interests as well as external factors forced upon him after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. His seminal paper in Economics, and some argue his last paper in Economics rather than probability theory, was published in 1915 (\"Sulla teoria del bilancio del consumatore\"). Paul Samuelson noted that until 1936, he had been entirely unaware of Slutsky's 1915 \"masterpiece\" due to World War I and the paper's Italian language publication. R. G. D. Allen did the most to propagate Slutsky's work on consumer theory in published papers in 1936 and 1950.Vincent Barnett argues:In the 1920s Slutsky turned to working on probability theory and stochastic processes, but in 1927 he published his second famous article on economic theory, 'The Summation of Random Causes as a Source of Cyclical Processes'. This showed that it was possible for apparently cyclic behaviour to emerge as the result of random shocks to the economy if the latter were modelled using a stable stochastic difference equation with certain technical properties. This opened up a new approach to business cycle theory by hypothesising that the interaction of chance events could generate periodicity when none existed initially.Slutsky's later work was principally in probability theory and the theory of stochastic processes. He is generally credited for the result known as Slutsky's theorem. In 1928 he was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in Bologna. \nQuestion: Which employer did Eugen Slutsky work for in Jul, 1943?",

The last years of the reign of Isabella II were times of growing discontent with her government and with the monarchy. Salmer\u00f3n joined a small party who advocated for the establishment of a republic. He was director of the opposition paper \"La Discusi\u00f3n\", and co-operated with Emilio Castelar on \"La Democracia\". In 1865 he was named one of the members of the directing committee of the Republican Party. In 1867 he was imprisoned with other suspects.When the revolution of September 1868 broke out, he was at Almer\u00eda recovering from a serious illness. Salmer\u00f3n was elected to the \"Cortes\" in 1871, and though he did not belong to the Socialist Party, defended its right to toleration. When Amadeo of Savoy resigned the Spanish crown on 11 February 1873 Salmer\u00f3n was naturally marked out to be a leader of the party which endeavoured to establish a republic in Spain. After serving as minister of justice in the Figueras cabinet, he was chosen president of the \"Cortes\", and then, on 18 July 1873, president of the Executive Power of the Republic, in succession to Francisco Pi y Margall. He became president at a time when the Federalist Party had thrown all the south of Spain into anarchy.Salmer\u00f3n was compelled to use the troops to restore order. When, however, he found that the generals insisted on executing rebels taken in arms, he resigned (September 6) on the ground that he was opposed to capital punishment. He was again elected president of the Cortes on September 9. His successor, Castelar, was compelled to restore order by drastic means. Salmer\u00f3n took part in the attack made on him in the \"Cortes\" on 3 January 1874, which provoked the generals into closing the chamber and establishing a provisional military government. Salmer\u00f3n went into exile and remained abroad till 1881, when he was recalled by Sagasta.In 1886, he was elected to the \"Cortes\" as Progressive deputy for Madrid, and unsuccessfully endeavoured to combine the jarring republican factions into a party of practical moderate views. On 18 April 1907 he was shot at, but not wounded, in the streets of Barcelona by a member of the more extreme Republican Party. He died at Pau on 21 September 1908 at the age of 70.He was the last living president of the First Spanish Republic. \nQuestion: Which political party did Nicol\u00e1s Salmer\u00f3n y Alonso belong to in Sep, 1903?",

He studied for the bar and became advocate in 1811. Having been elected Member of Parliament for the Ayr Burghs in 1818, he devoted the greater part of his life to the promotion of liberal reforms.In 1820 he married the only daughter of Sir Samuel Romilly. He was greatly assisted by Lord Cockburn, then Mr. Henry Cockburn, and a volume of correspondence published by Kennedy in 1874 forms a curious and interesting record of the consultations of the two friends on measures which they regarded as requisite for the political regeneration of their native country. One of the first measures to which he directed his attention was the withdrawal of the power of nominating juries from the judges, and the imparting of a right of peremptory challenge to prisoners. Among other subjects were the improvement of the parish schools, of pauper administration, and of several of the corrupt forms of legal procedure which then prevailed.Kennedy took a prominent part in the construction of the Scottish Reform Act 1832; indeed he and Lord Cockburn may almost be regarded as its authors. After the accession of the Whigs to office in 1832 he held office in the ministry as Clerk of the Ordnance in 1832 and as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from 1832 to 1834, and most of the measures of reform for Scotland, such as burgh reform, the improvements in the law of entail, and the reform of the sheriff courts, owed much to his sagacity and energy. In 1837 he went to Ireland as pay master of civil services, and set himself to the promotion of various measures of reform. Kennedy retired from office in 1854, but continued to take keen interest in political affairs and up to his death in 1879 took a great part in both county and parish business. He had a stern love of justice, and a determined hatred of everything savouring of corruption or dishonesty. \nQuestion: Which position did Thomas Francis Kennedy hold in Nov, 1818?",

Since 1994, younger people in that age group have also been able to become a member of Jusos without party membership. Until 2011 this was free, but ended after a two 2-year period. Today, it is possible to be a member of only Jusos until you reach your 35th birthday. However, there is now a membership fee of \u20ac1 per month.The Jusos were founded between 1918 and 1920, when groups of members of the SPD between 20 and 25 years of age began to meet. In terms of numbers, the Jusos remained small, with between 3,000 and 5,000 members. They were dissolved in 1931 as a result of an internal controversy.After the end of World War II, the Jusos was refounded in 1946. In their early years, they were a relatively indistinctive wing of the Social Democratic Party.In 1969, the Jusos moved to the left of their parent party. On their \"Bundeskongress\" (Federal Congress) they decided to become a left-wing political federation in their own right instead of being simply an extension of the SPD.

Vishniac, and grandson of photographer Roman Vishniac. He is the Editor-in-Chief of the Astrophysical Journal and a professor of Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, after holding positions at University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and University of Texas in Austin. His wife Ilene Busch-Vishniac, the ninth president of the University of Saskatchewan (2012-2014), was previously Dean of the Faculty of Engineering at Johns Hopkins, and provost and vice-president (academic) of McMaster University from 2007 until 2012.Vishniac graduated from University of Rochester and Harvard University. He received his Ph.D. in astrophysics in 1980 from Harvard University while working under the direction of William H. Press. After Harvard, Vishniac spent two years as a post doctoral fellow working under Jeremiah P. Ostriker at Princeton University.His best known scientific work is the study of instabilities in expanding blast waves. In Vishniac (1983), he demonstrated that a blast wave expanding in a sufficiently compressible medium would be subject to a linear overstability growing as the square root of time. This is usually known as the Vishniac instability, and generally occurs in any thin enough slab bounded by a shock on one side and a contact discontinuity to a higher temperature region on the other. In Vishniac (1994) he then demonstrated that a thin-enough slab bounded by shocks on both sides is subject to a nonlinear instability, usually described as a nonlinear thin shell instability (NTSI). He has also worked with success in cosmology and the theory of astrophysical dynamos. \nQuestion: Which employer did Ethan Vishniac work for in Jun, 2013?",

As the author and illustrator of the two volume \"Eagle's Complete Trees and Shrubs of New Zealand\" Eagle has made a notable contribution to New Zealand botany.Eagle began in 1954 to paint plants in order to assist with learning their botanical names. By 1968 she started planning a book with examples of every genus of tree and shrub in New Zealand. In 1975, after more than twenty years of work, \"Eagle's Trees and Shrubs of New Zealand in Colour\" was published. The book contained illustrations of 228 species, reproduced in life-size, with meticulous notes on identification, distribution and the source of the illustrated material. In 1982, she published a second book, illustrating a further 405 species and varieties. Both books were revised in 1986 to bring the nomenclature up to date. However, as a result of botanical research, a further revision was necessary. In 2006 Te Papa Press published the two-volume edition incorporating all of Eagle's previous illustrations, together with a further 173 new paintings, under the title \"Eagle's Complete Trees and Shrubs of New Zealand\".The voucher specimens and Eagle's personal botanical collection are contained in the Otago Regional Herbarium.Eagle was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2001 Queen's Birthday Honours, for services to botanical art. In 2007, the 2006 two-volume edition of \"Eagle's Complete Trees and Shrubs of New Zealand\" earned her the Montana Medal for Non-Fiction and the Booksellers Choice award. The University of Otago conferred an honorary doctor of science degree on her in Dunedin at a graduation ceremony on 4 May 2013.In 2017, Eagle was selected as one of the Royal Society Te Ap\u0101rangi's \"150 women in 150 words\", celebrating the contributions of women to knowledge in New Zealand. \nQuestion: Where was Audrey Eagle educated in Nov, 1938?",

Her first book, \"Angels in Late Ancient Christianity\", was published in 2013. A review in \"Bryn Mawr Classic Review\" noted that \"Muehlberger succeeds in demonstrating that angels were an important source of lively speculation and contestation within fourth and early-fifth century Christian discourse. The book also reveals how discourse on angels can provide an entry into other aspects of Christianity, like conceptualizations of the liturgy.\" The book has been reviewed in such journals as \"Journal of Theological Studies\", the \"American Historical Review\", the \"Journal of Early Christian Studies\", \"Horizons\", and \"Marginalia Review of Books\".Muehlberger's second book, \"The moment of Reckoning: Imagined Death and Its Consequences in Late Ancient Christianity\", was published in 2019 has also been well received. Another reviewer during a book panel published on \"Ancient Jew Review\", remarked, \"Muehlberger\u2019s conclusions have significant implications for our research on the machine of narrative and ethics.Muehlberger has also written numerous scholarly articles and chapters in collected volumes. She has edited The Cambridge Edition of Early Christian Writings and sits on the editorial boards of Studies of Late Antiquity, Bryn Mawr Classical Review, and Early Christianity in the Context of Antiquity.Muehlberger is an active contributor to public scholarship and has published in online publications such as \"Marginalia Review of Books\", where she has written on the \"architecture of knowledge\" in late antiquity and provided other editorial contributions as well. Muehlberger is an active public scholar on Twitter and has been credited as one of the popularizers of the term \"doomscrolling.\"Muehlberger was a Charles A. Ryskamp Research Fellow of the American Council of Learned Societies (2014-2015). In 2015 she received the Class of 1923 Memorial Teaching Award at the University of Michigan. She was also awarded a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship (2016-2017). \nQuestion: Which employer did Ellen Muehlberger work for in Jun, 2003?",

If until that year the Council was elected under a pure proportional system and the President of Lombardy was chosen and dismissed by the Council, since 1995 the President and the Council are jointly elected by the people.The Regional Council of Lombardy is composed of 80 members. From 1995 to 2012, 64 councillors were elected in provincial constituencies by proportional representation using the largest remainder method with a Droop quota and open lists, while 16 councillors (elected in bloc) came from a \"regional list\", including the President-elect. One seat was reserved for the candidate who came second. If a coalition won more than 40 seats with PR, as happened during the 2000 election, only 8 candidates from the regional list would be chosen and the number of those elected in provincial constituencies will be 72. If the winning coalition received less than 50% of votes, as happened during the 1995 election, special seats were added to the Council to ensure a large majority for the President's coalition.A new Lombard electoral law was adopted on 26 October 2012. While the President of Lombardy and the leader of the opposition are still elected at-large, 78 councillors, instead of 64 as it was before, are elected by party lists under a form of semi-proportional representation. The winning coalition receives a jackpot of at least 45 seats, which are divided between all majority parties using the D'Hondt method, as it happens between the losing lists. Each party then distributes its seats to its provincial lists, where candidates are openly selected.The Council is elected for a five-year term, but, if the President suffers a vote of no confidence, resigns or dies, under the \"simul stabunt, simul cadent\" clause introduced in 1999 (literally \"they will stand together or they will fall together\"), also the Council is dissolved and a snap election is called.The Council chooses its speaker, called President of the Council (\"Presidente del Consiglio\").The Council is composed of the following political groups:By coalition:This is a list of the Presidents of the Regional Council (Italian: \"Presidenti del Consiglio regionale\"): \nQuestion: Who was the chair of Regional Council of Lombardy in Aug, 2002?",

Economist Milton Friedman said Savage was \"one of the few people I have met whom I would unhesitatingly call a genius.\"He graduated from the University of Michigan and later worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan, Yale University, and the Statistical Research Group at Columbia University. Though his thesis advisor was Sumner Myers, he also credited Milton Friedman and W. Allen Wallis as statistical mentors.His most noted work was the 1954 book \"The Foundations of Statistics\", in which he put forward a theory of subjective and personal probability and statistics which forms one of the strands underlying Bayesian statistics and has applications to game theory.During World War II, Savage served as chief \"statistical\" assistant to John von Neumann, the mathematician credited with describing the principles upon which electronic computers should be based. Later he was one of the participants in the \"Macy conferences\" on cybernetics.One of Savage's indirect contributions was his discovery of the work of Louis Bachelier on stochastic models for asset prices and the mathematical theory of option pricing. Savage brought the work of Bachelier to the attention of Paul Samuelson. It was from Samuelson's subsequent writing that \"random walk\" (and subsequently Brownian motion) became fundamental to mathematical finance.In 1951 he introduced the minimax regret criterion used in decision theory.The Hewitt\u2013Savage zero\u2013one law is (in part) named after him, as is the Friedman\u2013Savage utility function. \nQuestion: Which employer did Leonard Jimmie Savage work for in Dec, 1944?",

He served until May 1945, when he was captured by the British. He returned to his former career, and joined the Iron and Metal Industry Association, which soon became part of IG Metall. He joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD), and gradually rose to more prominent positions in the union. From 1959, he was its district secretary for youth work and shop stewards.IG Metall was affiliated to the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB), and in 1963, Loderer was elected as the federation's Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg district secretary. In 1966, he took a leading role in an anti-fascist rally outside the conference of the National Democratic Party of Germany, and this propelled him to national attention.In 1968, Loderer was elected as deputy president of IG Metall, with the backing of president Otto Brenner. He was the union's lead on public relations, human resources, organisation, and administration. Brenner died in 1972, and Loderer was elected as his successor. While Loderer initially campaigned on issues such as banning lockouts, and expanding the role of workers in company management, the economic crisis led him to a more defensive position, and a focus on collective bargaining. He also presided over five major strikes. He was staunchly opposed to communists in the union, or to any co-operation with unions affiliated to the communist World Federation of Trade Unions, and criticised the peace movement for not spending enough time attacking the Soviet Union.In 1974, Loderer was elected as president of the International Metalworkers' Federation. He was elected in the European Parliament election, 1979, for the SPD in Hesse, but he stood down in January 1980, as he found the workload was incompatible with remaining leader of the union.

Lemaitre has also authored several books on the topic of narcissism in science.Lemaitre obtained a PhD in genetics from the Universit\u00e9 Pierre-et-Marie-Curie in 1992, defending a thesis on the regulation of P element transposition in Drosophila. He then pursued work as research associate in the laboratory of Jules Hoffmann, where he identified Toll-like receptors as essential mediators of innate immunity in Drosophila. This work was considered as a landmark paper by the Nobel prize committee and was featured in the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded to Hoffmann. In 1998, he was appointed group leader at the Molecular Genetics Center of the French National Center for Scientific Research in Gif-sur-Yvette. He moved to EPFL in 2007 as a full professor within the Global Health Institute.Lemaitre has since 2016 published several books and essays related to the topic of narcissism in science and society. He is co-author of various MOOCs and an exercise book in French on the topic of immunology.The Lemaitre laboratory studies various aspects of innate immunity using Drosophila as a genetic model. The laboratory uses genetic screens as tools to identify novel factors involved in the immune response following microbial infection. His team has contributed to the better understanding the role of the Toll and NF-\u03baB pathways in the activation of bacterial defense, as well as how the host's immune system discriminates between different bacterial pathogens. Lemaitre also studies host-microbiota interactions, and more specifically how the microbiota influences gut homeostasis and morphology.Another aspect of interest to Lemaitre is to decipher the roles and mechanisms of the interactions occurring between Drosophila and its endosymbionts of the spiroplasma genus.Lemaitre received two \"Advanced Grants\" from the European Research Council for projects on gut immunity and homeostasis (2008) and Drosophila-Spiroplasma interactions (2013).Lemaitre was elected as an EMBO member in 2007.He received several research prizes, such as the Noury, Thorlet, Lazare Prize from the French Academy of Sciences (2001), the First Prize of the Schlumberger Foundation (2002), the William B.

Flagg, of Grand Manan, New Brunswick.Gould left school at the age of 14 and started work for 4 shillings a week.In 1901 he obtained a position as an ordinary sailor on the ship \"Clan Graham\", and sailed for South Africa where he worked as a piecemeal laborer. He later moved from South Africa to New York where he worked for an insurance company.In 1912 he opened his own insurance company in London with offices in Belgium and Germany. The business closed within a year and Gould won a \u00a320,000 award against a partner in New York for misrepresentation.In 1915, with a capital of \u00a3200, Gould committed to buy the SS \"Dartsmouth\" for \u00a336,000. Due to the need for ships during the First World War to carry troops and goods, the venture was extremely successful, bringing capital to Gould and his company, Goulds Steamships & Industrials Ltd of \u00a360,000 within 6 months. The profits were re-invested with the purchase of a \u00a31,000,000 navy and shipbuilding business. By the end of the War it was estimated that Gould's personal fortune was around \u00a32\u00a0million. After the war there was a major recession in the maritime sector, with the number of shipping companies in Cardiff falling from 150 to 77; the Gould company went bankrupt with debts of over \u00a3750,000 in May 1925. In March 1926 he was discharged from bankruptcy on condition of paying \u00a350,000 towards his debts. He failed to pay the \u00a350,000 and was made bankrupt again in 1933. He was acquitted of the second bankruptcy, postponed for two years, in June 1934.Gould was a member of the City of Cardiff Council between 1917 and 1918. He stood for the Unionist Party (effectively the Conservative Party) in the elections of 1918, 1922 and 1923, winning the Cardiff Central constituency. As his debtors were congregating, and an MP could not be bankrupt, he decided not to contest the 1924 election, and his Parliamentary career came to an end.He died at his home in Coulsdon, Surrey, England at the age of 62. \nQuestion: Which position did James Childs Gould hold in Dec, 1922?",

The building is three stories high and based on an Elizabethan-style \"E\"-shaped plan. The design is similar to that of the station but more subdued; the building was extended in 1878. The building is mainly brick-built, with blue stone diapering and a plain tiled roof and Dutch-style gables above the outer and central bay windows. The central ground floor bay forms a porch. The hotel was built to resemble an Elizabethan manor house. The hotel quickly built an up a good reputation and, within a few years, was regarded as one most important hotels in Staffordshire.When the County Borough of Stoke on Trent was formed in 1910, incorporating six towns, the hotel was chosen the venue for the inaugural meeting of the local council to avoid showing a bias by using one of the six town halls\u2014a matter of local sensitivity at the time. Subsequent meetings rotated between the town halls before the council decided to permanently locate itself in Stoke.The NSR preferred to lease the building, with limited success. When the NSR was amalgamated into the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923, the LMS took over the hotel and found the business in poor condition. When a lease expired in 1931, the LMS took the management of the hotel into its own hands and undertook an extensive refurbishment of the building. The hotel has been expanded several times during its history, including additional buildings to the rear, in order to provide more bedrooms and kitchen space. Not all the extensions were conducted sympathetically to the original architectural style, resulting in a variety of architectural styles to the rear of the building.The hotel became a listed building in 1972 and is listed in grade II*. It is located on Winton Square, immediately opposite Stoke-on-Trent railway station, and is one of four listed buildings on the square. The station itself is grade II* listed, and a statue of local potter Josiah Wedgwood is grade II listed; a row of railway cottages forms another grade II listed building. Winton Square is described as the UK's only piece of town planning undertaken by railway company specifically to set off a station.The hotel, by then owned by the nationalised British Rail, was sold in 1953 and today is owned by the Britannia Hotels chain, who acquired it in November 2002; it has 88 bedrooms. \nQuestion: Who was the owner of North Stafford Hotel in Jun, 1885?",

In 2008 he was appointed associate professor, and in 2017 full professor. Before that, he worked at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, and MIT in the United States. He received his PhD from the University of Amsterdam in 1999 with a thesis entitled \"Millisecond phenomena in X-ray binaries\".His research focuses on the accretion of matter onto neutron stars and black holes, which are very compact stellar remnants. He uses X-ray space telescopes such as Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton to observe the X-ray emission from these objects. In particular he studies neutron stars and black holes when they are accreting at very low rates. He also investigates the rate at which neutron stars cool after they have been heated by accretion, in order to learn about their interior composition. Furthermore, Wijnands has been involved in research into quasi-periodic oscillations.In 1998, Wijnands and his PhD advisor Michiel van der Klis discovered coherent millisecond X-ray pulsations in the persistent flux of the X-ray binary SAX J1808.4-3658. This was strong evidence for the model in which radio millisecond pulsars are spun up to periods of a few milliseconds by the accretion of matter from a companion star in an X-ray binary.In 2006 Wijnands received the Bruno Rossi Prize along with Deepto Chakrabarty and Tod Strohmayer \"for their pioneering research which revealed millisecond spin periods and established the powerful diagnostic tool of kilohertz intensity oscillations in accreting neutron star binary systems\". \nQuestion: Which employer did Rudy Wijnands work for in Oct, 2002?",

He was the fourth of eleven children of Jacob Bright and Martha Wood. His father was a Quaker and had established a cotton-spinning business at Fieldhouse. His elder brother, John Bright, was a radical politician, and his sister, Priscilla Bright McLaren, campaigned for women's rights.Jacob Bright was educated at the Friends School in York before entering the family business of John Bright & Brothers, cotton-spinners. Bright and his brother Thomas managed the firm, and by 1885 the business had expanded into carpet manufacture. He was also responsible for introducing the linotype machine to England.Bright became involved in radical politics and supported Chartism. He was the first mayor of Rochdale on the town's incorporation as a municipal borough. He stood for election in 1865 in Manchester. Although unsuccessful on his first attempt, he won a by-election in 1867. The election was notable because Lilly Maxwell voted for Bright. This vote by a woman was later overturned.Bright held his seat at the general election in 1868. He lost his seat at the 1874 general election, but was returned to parliament at the by-election in 1876. When the three-seat Parliamentary Borough of Manchester was divided into eight single-seat constituencies in 1885, Bright was selected as the Liberal candidate for the new Manchester South West constituency. He was defeated in 1885, but successful in the general election in 1886. As a Member of Parliament, Bright was considered an \"advanced radical\". He was a peace campaigner and supported women's suffrage.Bright remained as MP for South West Manchester until in 1895. Upon retirement, Bright was sworn into the privy council at the suggestion of Lord Rosebery. Jacob Bright died at midnight on 7/8 November 1899, aged 78, at his residence, \"Nunn's Acre\", Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. He was cremated without a funeral service. The central committee of the Society for Women's Suffrage passed a resolution recognising his contribution to the movement.In 1855, Bright married Ursula Mellor Bright, daughter of a Liverpool merchant and campaigner for women's rights.

It initially had 230,464 members. In 1947, its name was changed to the Industrial Union of Chemicals, Paper and Ceramics, and then in 1950 it was shortened to the Industrial Union of Chemicals.The remit of the union also changed over the years. In 1955, its members in the building materials sector were transferred to the Industrial Union of Construction and Wood, and in 1956 various members moved to the Industrial Union of the Local Economy, although they returned in 1958. The biggest changes came in 1957, when the union's headquarters moved from Berlin to Halle, and its members in textile manufacturing and forestry were transferred to other unions.Internationally, the union affiliated to the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers. The union became involved in sports associations, their names starting with \"SV Chemie\".The membership of the union continued to change until the 1972, when it also adopted its final name, the \"Industrial Union of Chemicals, Glass and Ceramics\". In addition to these areas, it also represented workers in the paper and petroleum industries, and in waste disposal.By 1989, the union had 531,301 members. It became independent in April 1990.

Economist Milton Friedman said Savage was \"one of the few people I have met whom I would unhesitatingly call a genius.\"He graduated from the University of Michigan and later worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan, Yale University, and the Statistical Research Group at Columbia University. Though his thesis advisor was Sumner Myers, he also credited Milton Friedman and W. Allen Wallis as statistical mentors.His most noted work was the 1954 book \"The Foundations of Statistics\", in which he put forward a theory of subjective and personal probability and statistics which forms one of the strands underlying Bayesian statistics and has applications to game theory.During World War II, Savage served as chief \"statistical\" assistant to John von Neumann, the mathematician credited with describing the principles upon which electronic computers should be based. Later he was one of the participants in the \"Macy conferences\" on cybernetics.One of Savage's indirect contributions was his discovery of the work of Louis Bachelier on stochastic models for asset prices and the mathematical theory of option pricing. Savage brought the work of Bachelier to the attention of Paul Samuelson. It was from Samuelson's subsequent writing that \"random walk\" (and subsequently Brownian motion) became fundamental to mathematical finance.In 1951 he introduced the minimax regret criterion used in decision theory.The Hewitt\u2013Savage zero\u2013one law is (in part) named after him, as is the Friedman\u2013Savage utility function. \nQuestion: Which employer did Leonard Jimmie Savage work for in Dec, 1941?",

There, he won the Third Division title for the first time (Palace had only gone up in third place). He then transferred back to south-London, to Millwall, where he won promotion to Division 2. He was the sold for a nominal sum along with Nicky Chatterton to Colchester United and then went to non-league clubs Basildon United, Dartford and Chelmsford City.Later, he would reunite with former Palace teammate Steve Kember, as his assistant at Whyteleafe, and would become their manager after Kember left to take up a coaching role at Palace.Hinshelwood's family also have a strong footballing background. His father Wally was a professional footballer in the 1950s and '60s, most notably at Reading and Bristol City. His older brother Martin played for Crystal Palace before his career was cut short because of injury, and is currently Director of Football at Brighton.

At the time of his death he was Crossett Professor Emeritus of Humanistic Studies at Stanford University.His father, Raymond D. Jameson, professor of Western literature at the University of Peking, and mother, Rose Perel Jameson, were visiting London at the time of his birth. He spent his childhood in Beijing and with his mother in London, received his A.B. in Greek at the University of Chicago in 1942, aged seventeen, served in the U.S. Navy as a Japanese translator, 1943\u201346, then married Virginia Broyles. He received his Ph.D. at Chicago in 1949, with a dissertation on \"The Offering at Meals: Its Place in Greek Sacrifice\". A Fulbright Fellowship in 1949 supported him at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, where he hiked the Peloponnesos with his new wife and gained an intimate knowledge of inscriptions. After a brief stint at the University of Minnesota, he accepted a Ford Fellowship at the Institute for Social Anthropology at Oxford University. On his return to the United States, be began his long association with the University of Pennsylvania (1954\u201376).Though a spirit of perfectionism inhibited his production of an overarching book, in some sixty articles he explored the setting of Greek religion in its specific locality and time, thus focusing on unravelling the details of cult and ritual sacrifice; he did a great deal of work on epigraphy and its relations with literature and history, and he explored Greek sites, especially at the partly drowned port city of Halieis (Porto Cheli), which he began excavating in 1962, and in the Argolid, where he galvanized a broad ecological study, 1979\u201383, that was the first examination of the paleoecology of ancient Greece, resulting in the publication of M. H. Jameson, Tjeerd Van Andel and C. N.

The discovery, which adjusted the historian's view drawn from Thucydides, elicited an extensive literature, including four articles by Jameson, setting the text in its historical context.He received numerous awards and visiting fellowships, including a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1966\u201367, and inspired a generation of scholars through his teaching. He died of cancer.Jameson contributed popular articles to encyclopedias: \"Greek Mythology\" in N. Kramer, \"The Mythologies of the Ancient World\" 1961, and \"Mythology, Classical\" in \"Collier's Encyclopedia\" 17 (1995:115-17).His articles are widely scattered. \nQuestion: Which employer did Michael H.

Clara was nine years older than Woldemar. Throughout their lives, they enjoyed a warm relationship. The initial opportunities which led to the success and recognition he enjoyed were due to Clara, who introduced him to both Robert Schumann and Felix Mendelssohn. Bargiel received his first lessons at home and later with the well-known Berlin teacher of music theory Siegfried Wilhelm Dehn. Upon the suggestion of Schumann and the recommendation of Mendelssohn, Bargiel at age 16 went to study at the famous Leipzig Conservatory with some of the leading scholars of music: Ignaz Moscheles (piano) and Niels Gade (composition), and also with Julius Rietz. After leaving Leipzig in 1850, he returned to Berlin where he tried to make ends meet by giving private lessons. Eventually, Clara and Robert were able to arrange for the publication of some of his early works, including his First Piano Trio.Subsequently, Bargiel held positions at the conservatories in Cologne and Rotterdam (where he met Hermine Tours, his future wife, sister of the composer Berthold Tours) before accepting a position at the prestigious Hochschule fur Musik in Berlin where he taught for the rest of his life. Among his many students were Paul Juon, Waldemar von Bau\u00dfnern, Alexander Ilyinsky, Agnes Tschetschulin, and Leopold Godowsky.

Currently playing in the first division, it holds home games at the Paralimni Municipal Stadium \"Tasos Marcou\", which holds 5,800 people.Enosis Neon Paralimniou was founded in April 1944, following the merger of two Paralimni clubs, Heracles and People's Love.The club's emblem is the Parthenon, with a trumpeter and the year 1936 inscription, birth year of the club Heracles. The only reason why founders decided to adopt the year 1936 as the new club's birth year instead of the year 1944 has purely to do with Heracles official papers. On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4\u20135 loss).The team\u2019s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore. Moore donated West Ham United kits for the team to play in 1971, 2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division . These colours became an established part of the club itself.Until the early 1960s, Enosis took part only in local competitions, since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions, stating that only clubs based in towns could take part. The CFA's denial was the reason why Enosis joined E.A.P.O., a village-based club association. In 1965, the CFA changed its rules and Enosis finally managed to join and participate in the second division. From the very beginning, the side tried to win promotion to the first division and, after four attempts, managed to finish first, in the football season of 1968\u201369. Since then, Enosis has taken part in all 45 editions of first division, being one of only five clubs never to have been demoted into the second division until 2013\u201314, when it was relegated for the first time to the second division after finishing 13th in the league. \nQuestion: Who was the head coach of the team Enosis Neon Paralimni FC in Mar, 2022?",

In 2003, Telia had to sell Com Hem to EQT Partners as a result of its merger with Sonera of Finland that same year.In 2021 the company had 135+ TV channels available. Digital TV was introduced in 1997. A broadband service that used the company's proprietary cable network was launched in 1999. In 2004 VoIP telephone was introduced and the company became Sweden's first nationwide triple play service provider.All households connected to the Com Hem Cable Network had access to broadband Internet services, services, fixed-line telephony and a wide range of TV channels. Com Hem also provided interactive services that facilitated management, communication and maintenance for property owners.The company had around 1000 employees, with offices in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malm\u00f6, V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, H\u00e4rn\u00f6sand, Sundsvall and \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik.In 2011, EQT sold the company to BC Partners.

It was then relegated to the Beta Ethniki again in 2006\u201307 and returned to the top tier in 2007\u201308.

Vishniac, and grandson of photographer Roman Vishniac. He is the Editor-in-Chief of the Astrophysical Journal and a professor of Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, after holding positions at University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and University of Texas in Austin. His wife Ilene Busch-Vishniac, the ninth president of the University of Saskatchewan (2012-2014), was previously Dean of the Faculty of Engineering at Johns Hopkins, and provost and vice-president (academic) of McMaster University from 2007 until 2012.Vishniac graduated from University of Rochester and Harvard University. He received his Ph.D. in astrophysics in 1980 from Harvard University while working under the direction of William H. Press. After Harvard, Vishniac spent two years as a post doctoral fellow working under Jeremiah P. Ostriker at Princeton University.His best known scientific work is the study of instabilities in expanding blast waves. In Vishniac (1983), he demonstrated that a blast wave expanding in a sufficiently compressible medium would be subject to a linear overstability growing as the square root of time. This is usually known as the Vishniac instability, and generally occurs in any thin enough slab bounded by a shock on one side and a contact discontinuity to a higher temperature region on the other. In Vishniac (1994) he then demonstrated that a thin-enough slab bounded by shocks on both sides is subject to a nonlinear instability, usually described as a nonlinear thin shell instability (NTSI). He has also worked with success in cosmology and the theory of astrophysical dynamos. \nQuestion: Which employer did Ethan Vishniac work for in Nov, 2006?",

He received his doctoral degree at the University of Vienna in 1910. He spent the winter semester 1910/11 at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, then he was an assistant at the German Technical University in Brno, and from 1912 to 1919 at the Technical University of Vienna. In 1913/14, he passed his habilitation at the University of Vienna. Due to his near-sightedness, he was exempt from the draft during wartime.In 1919, he was called to become Professor extraordinarius at the newly founded University of Hamburg; in 1922, he became \"Professor ordinarius\" at the University of Greifswald, and in 1925 at the University of Erlangen.

In 1954/55, he was rector of the University of Vienna.In 1939, Radon became corresponding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, and in 1947, he became a member. From 1952 to 1956, he was Secretary of the Class of Mathematics and Science of this Academy. From 1948 to 1950, he was president of the Austrian Mathematical Society.Johann Radon married Maria Rigele, a secondary school teacher, in 1916. They had three sons who died young or very young. Their daughter Brigitte, born in 1924, obtained a Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Innsbruck and married the Austrian mathematician Erich Bukovics in 1950. Brigitte lives in Vienna.Radon, as Curt C. Christian described him in 1987 at the occasion of the unveiling of his brass bust at the University of Vienna, was a friendly, good-natured man, highly esteemed by students and colleagues alike, a noble personality. He did make the impression of a quiet scholar, but he was also sociable and willing to celebrate. He loved music, and he played music with friends at home, being an excellent violinist himself, and a good singer. His love for classical literature lasted through all his life.In 2003, the Austrian Academy of Sciences founded an Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics and named it after Johann Radon (see the external link below).Radon is known for a number of lasting contributions, including: \nQuestion: Which employer did Johann Radon work for in Sep, 1922?",

Currently playing in the first division, it holds home games at the Paralimni Municipal Stadium \"Tasos Marcou\", which holds 5,800 people.Enosis Neon Paralimniou was founded in April 1944, following the merger of two Paralimni clubs, Heracles and People's Love.The club's emblem is the Parthenon, with a trumpeter and the year 1936 inscription, birth year of the club Heracles. The only reason why founders decided to adopt the year 1936 as the new club's birth year instead of the year 1944 has purely to do with Heracles official papers. On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4\u20135 loss).The team\u2019s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore. Moore donated West Ham United kits for the team to play in 1971, 2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division . These colours became an established part of the club itself.Until the early 1960s, Enosis took part only in local competitions, since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions, stating that only clubs based in towns could take part. The CFA's denial was the reason why Enosis joined E.A.P.O., a village-based club association. In 1965, the CFA changed its rules and Enosis finally managed to join and participate in the second division. From the very beginning, the side tried to win promotion to the first division and, after four attempts, managed to finish first, in the football season of 1968\u201369. Since then, Enosis has taken part in all 45 editions of first division, being one of only five clubs never to have been demoted into the second division until 2013\u201314, when it was relegated for the first time to the second division after finishing 13th in the league. \nQuestion: Who was the head coach of the team Enosis Neon Paralimni FC in Apr, 2020?",

The building is mainly brick-built, with blue stone diapering and a plain tiled roof and Dutch-style gables above the outer and central bay windows. The central ground floor bay forms a porch. The hotel was built to resemble an Elizabethan manor house. The hotel quickly built an up a good reputation and, within a few years, was regarded as one most important hotels in Staffordshire.When the County Borough of Stoke on Trent was formed in 1910, incorporating six towns, the hotel was chosen the venue for the inaugural meeting of the local council to avoid showing a bias by using one of the six town halls\u2014a matter of local sensitivity at the time. Subsequent meetings rotated between the town halls before the council decided to permanently locate itself in Stoke.The NSR preferred to lease the building, with limited success. When the NSR was amalgamated into the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923, the LMS took over the hotel and found the business in poor condition. When a lease expired in 1931, the LMS took the management of the hotel into its own hands and undertook an extensive refurbishment of the building. The hotel has been expanded several times during its history, including additional buildings to the rear, in order to provide more bedrooms and kitchen space. Not all the extensions were conducted sympathetically to the original architectural style, resulting in a variety of architectural styles to the rear of the building.The hotel became a listed building in 1972 and is listed in grade II*. It is located on Winton Square, immediately opposite Stoke-on-Trent railway station, and is one of four listed buildings on the square. The station itself is grade II* listed, and a statue of local potter Josiah Wedgwood is grade II listed; a row of railway cottages forms another grade II listed building. Winton Square is described as the UK's only piece of town planning undertaken by railway company specifically to set off a station.The hotel, by then owned by the nationalised British Rail, was sold in 1953 and today is owned by the Britannia Hotels chain, who acquired it in November 2002; it has 88 bedrooms. \nQuestion: Who was the owner of North Stafford Hotel in Dec, 2022?",

There are boulevards, avenues with tram lines, and communist-era housing estates in the district. Line 4 of the Budapest metro passes through \u00dajbuda.Traffic to Budapest from Western Hungary enters the city in this district; a main road, Buda\u00f6rsi \u00fat is the direct continuation of motorways M1 and M7.

Currently playing in the first division, it holds home games at the Paralimni Municipal Stadium \"Tasos Marcou\", which holds 5,800 people.Enosis Neon Paralimniou was founded in April 1944, following the merger of two Paralimni clubs, Heracles and People's Love.The club's emblem is the Parthenon, with a trumpeter and the year 1936 inscription, birth year of the club Heracles. The only reason why founders decided to adopt the year 1936 as the new club's birth year instead of the year 1944 has purely to do with Heracles official papers. On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4\u20135 loss).The team\u2019s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore. Moore donated West Ham United kits for the team to play in 1971, 2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division . These colours became an established part of the club itself.Until the early 1960s, Enosis took part only in local competitions, since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions, stating that only clubs based in towns could take part. The CFA's denial was the reason why Enosis joined E.A.P.O., a village-based club association. In 1965, the CFA changed its rules and Enosis finally managed to join and participate in the second division. From the very beginning, the side tried to win promotion to the first division and, after four attempts, managed to finish first, in the football season of 1968\u201369. Since then, Enosis has taken part in all 45 editions of first division, being one of only five clubs never to have been demoted into the second division until 2013\u201314, when it was relegated for the first time to the second division after finishing 13th in the league. \nQuestion: Who was the head coach of the team Enosis Neon Paralimni FC in Sep, 2017?",

Currently playing in the first division, it holds home games at the Paralimni Municipal Stadium \"Tasos Marcou\", which holds 5,800 people.Enosis Neon Paralimniou was founded in April 1944, following the merger of two Paralimni clubs, Heracles and People's Love.The club's emblem is the Parthenon, with a trumpeter and the year 1936 inscription, birth year of the club Heracles. The only reason why founders decided to adopt the year 1936 as the new club's birth year instead of the year 1944 has purely to do with Heracles official papers. On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4\u20135 loss).The team\u2019s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore. Moore donated West Ham United kits for the team to play in 1971, 2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division . These colours became an established part of the club itself.Until the early 1960s, Enosis took part only in local competitions, since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions, stating that only clubs based in towns could take part. The CFA's denial was the reason why Enosis joined E.A.P.O., a village-based club association. In 1965, the CFA changed its rules and Enosis finally managed to join and participate in the second division. From the very beginning, the side tried to win promotion to the first division and, after four attempts, managed to finish first, in the football season of 1968\u201369. Since then, Enosis has taken part in all 45 editions of first division, being one of only five clubs never to have been demoted into the second division until 2013\u201314, when it was relegated for the first time to the second division after finishing 13th in the league. \nQuestion: Who was the head coach of the team Enosis Neon Paralimni FC in Aug, 2018?",

He was an early Zionist and the first Dean of Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is known for his contributions to axiomatic set theory, especially his additions to Ernst Zermelo's axioms, which resulted in the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory.Abraham Adolf Halevi Fraenkel studied mathematics at the Universities of Munich, Berlin, Marburg and Breslau. After graduating, he lectured at the University of Marburg from 1916, and was promoted to professor in 1922.In 1919 he married Wilhelmina Malka A. Prins (1892\u20131983). Due to the severe housing shortage in post-war Germany, for a few years the couple lived as subtenants at professor Hensel's place.After leaving Marburg in 1928, Fraenkel taught at the University of Kiel for a year. He then made the fateful choice of accepting a position at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which had been founded four years earlier, where he spent the rest of his career. He became the first Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics, and for a while served as Rector of the University.Fraenkel was a fervent Zionist and as such was a member of Jewish National Council and the Jewish Assembly of Representatives under the British mandate. He also belonged to the Mizrachi religious wing of Zionism, which promoted Jewish religious education and schools, and which advocated giving the Chief Rabbinate authority over marriage and divorce.Fraenkel's early work was on Kurt Hensel's p-adic numbers and on the theory of rings. He is best known for his work on axiomatic set theory, publishing his first major work on the topic \"Einleitung in die Mengenlehre\" (Introduction to set theory) in 1919. In 1922 and 1925, he published two papers that sought to improve Zermelo's axiomatic system; the result is the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms. Fraenkel worked in set theory and foundational mathematics.Fraenkel also was interested in the history of mathematics, writing in 1920 and 1930 about Gauss's works in algebra, and he published a biography of Georg Cantor. After retiring from the Hebrew University and being succeeded by his former student Abraham Robinson, Fraenkel continued teaching at the Bar Ilan University in Ramat Gan (near Tel Aviv). \nQuestion: Which employer did Abraham Fraenkel work for in Jul, 1947?",

    "Definition": [
        "The task involves solving real-world reasoning problems that require temporal calculations and logical reasoning based on age or duration. Specifically, the model should handle situations where the input provides two time-related values (such as age in years and months) and asks for the difference between them. The goal is to compute the elapsed time or duration, often involving subtraction of time values in a human-readable format, such as years and months. The task also includes dealing with edge cases where months and years need to be properly calculated, ensuring that calculations account for varying lengths of time units."
